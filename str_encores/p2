\f3\s+9Two Encores for Strings\s-9\fP

\f2Two Encores for Strings\fP are written for six players,
but performances with twelve or more players are also intended.

They share the 2+2+2 sextet instrumentation of
my \f2Music for Strings\fP,
and of my transcription of Bach's \f2Ricercare a 6\fP,
and of Schoenberg's chamber version of \f2Verklaerte Nacht\fP,
and of Korngold's Op.10 sextet,
and are also not far from the chamber-septet version
of John Adams' \f2Shaker Loops\fP (which adds a bass,
and uses three violins and one viola rather than two and two).

In the event of a concert involving those pieces,
it is hoped the \f2Two Encores for Strings\fP might be useful.

The first would move at about 60 - 72 quarter-notes per minute,
and would last approximately 2min 20sec.

The second would move at about 160 dotted-eigths per minute,
except for the last six bars at about 60 quarter-notes per minute,
and would last approximately 2min.
