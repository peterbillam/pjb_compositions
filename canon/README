E.G.  For an invertible canon at +2 st, in 3 voices,
if the first notes in the segment are 0,3,6 (abs)
then the first notes at the start of the next segment will be 2,5,8
then 4,7,10   then 6,9,12
So the first voice has to start its segments
either on 0 then 5 then 10 then 6
    or on 0 then 8 then  7 then 6

For an invertible canon at +n st, in 3 voices,
if the first notes in the segment are 0,a,b (abs)
then the first notes at the start of the next segment will be n,a+n,b+n
then 2n,a+2n,b+2n   then 3n,a+3n,b+3n
So the first voice has to start its segments
either on 0 then a+n  then b+2n then 3n
    or on 0 then a+2n then b+n  then 3n

This tells you how to lead the three voices through the segment,
given the initial notes and the desired canon-interval.

Halving the block-size from two bars to one...
Starting from AABBCC:
  A      A      B+n    B+n    C+2n   C+2n
  C      C      A+n    A+n    B+2n   B+2n
  B      B      C+n    C+n    A+2n   A+2n
Moving to ACBACB (preserves alternate bars):
  A      C+z    B+n    A+n+x  C+2n   B+2n+y
  C      C      A+n    C+n+z  B+2n   A+2n+x
  B      B      C+n    C+n    A+2n   C+2n+z
Moving to ABCABC:
  A      B+y    C+n+z  A+n+x  B+2n+y C+2n+z
  C      C      A+n    B+n+y  C+2n+z A+2n
  B      B      C+n    C+n    A+2n   B+2n+y
(z is overdetermined; must fit bar 3 then also bar 5; x is unneeded)
