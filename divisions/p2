\f3Divisions on an Italian Ground\fP
for flute and guitar is one of Peter Billam's early compositions.
It was written in 1980 when he was living in Biel, Switzerland,
and actively playing both guitar and flute.
It is a set of variations on the theme from
Robert Carr's piece of the same name;
there are also references to Brahms' Paganini Variations.

The following tempo suggestions are editorial only,
and should be disregarded with a clear conscience.
The theme could be taken at around 88,
the second variation \f2Etwas rasch\fP at about 96 crochets per minute,
the fifth \f2Immer staccato\fP at about 63 bars per minute,
the eighth \f2Ausdrücksvoll\fP at about 56 crochets per minute,
and the final \f2Etwas langsamer als das Thema\fP at about 80.

Also available is the piece of the same title by Robert Carr,
taken from \f2The Delightful Companion:
or, Choice new lessons for the Recorder or Flute\fP published
by John Carr in 1686,
with the continuo realised for guitar in 1980 by Peter Billam.
The solo part can be played on Alto Recorder, as foreseen by Robert Carr,
or on Flute, making a companion piece for Peter Billam's variations.
Carr's \f2Delightful Companion\fP was initially published in 1682,
though no copies of this first edition are extant.
The divisions turn up again in the 1695 edition of
\f2The Division Violin\fP and are also republished in 1708
(with fewer ornaments) in \f2The Second Part of the Division Flute
containing a Collection of Divisions upon Several Excellent Grounds
for the Flute being very Improving and Delightfull to all Lovers
of that Instrument\fP.
