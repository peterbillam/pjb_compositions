\f3\s+9Three Suites\s-9\fP
.sp 2.0c
.PP
The first suite is for the solo line; flute or violin would be ideal.
The movements are marked
\f2\s+1Running\s0\fP, \f2\s+1Singing\s0\fP and \f2\s+1Dancing\s0\fP.
On recorder, the first and last movements lie within the range of the
alto recorder, and the second movement can be played as is on the tenor;
however, the recorder player may prefer to play it
transposed up five semitones on the alto,
which usually has a far sweeter melodic tone.
On wind instruments, unmarked breaths will be needed.
In some places, if the player prefers, quavers can even be omitted;
a quaver that repeats a recent note should be chosen.
On the piano, this suite can be played one octave down
by the right hand alone, or evenly divided between the hands.
Versions are also available one octave down in the alto clef, for viola,
and two octaves down in the bass clef, for cello, or left-handed piano,
and eight semitones down for the guitar.

The second suite is for piano alone.
The movements are marked
\f2\s+1Turbulent\s0\fP, \f2\s+1Calm\s0\fP and \f2\s+1Luminous\s0\fP.
The first movement almost lies within four octaves and can be played on
other keyboards, for example a harpsichord;
in the second and third movements the composer was tempted by the
extra compass and sustain of the piano.

The third suite is for piano and a solo line;
again, flute or violin would be ideal.
The notes do lie within the compass of the alto recorder,
but the execution would be difficult on that instrument.
The movements are marked
\f2\s+1Fluent\s0\fP, \f2\s+1Broad\s0\fP and \f2\s+1Wild\s0\fP.
