Of my Three Suites, written in the year 2000.
the first is for the solo line,
the second is for piano, and the third for solo line and piano.
Thus, together, the suites form a kind of happy-ending story;
song meets dance, or boy meets girl, or melody meets harmony,
whichever way you want to see it.

During 2000 I was recovering from radiotherapy,
and the Suites are a sort of invocation of the Spirit of Happy Endings.
They remain important to me, though I think my subsequent works,
such as the Preludes, or the Guitar Duet, are better compositions.
All these scores can be downloaded from www.pjb.com.au

Each Suite has three movements (fast-slow-fast),
and the outer movements of the Third Suite are marked "Flowing" and "Wild".
These are the most technically demanding movements in the Suites,
but the difficulties should meet more than their match tonight
at the hands of Lloyd Hudson (flute) and Karen Smithies (piano).
