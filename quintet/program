Trombone Quintet
.LP
"The instruments played by these five musicians
are so different from each other
that I decided for the first time in recent years
to enjoy indulging their natures,
to have each one speak in its own voice,
to choose its own notes for the common purpose.
.LP
"From the jazz quintet I took the idea of
each instrument playing a role in a niche, with a turn in the spotlight;
from the orchestra I took the width of range of mood and colour.
.LP
"My language continues to develop along the path of recent works,
not discordant though not tonal,
not repetitious but with rythmic structure on a range of time-scales.
.LP
"The piece is not without its serious side,
but overall the mood is lighter, clearer;
more happy, more human."
