i = integer
e = even integer

0i0 = two-voice. Every movement of one or of both voices is allowed,
     except those completing a 43, or forming a semitone dischord.

one of those voices can be deemed to be two voices in unison,
which can then divide, yielding 0i2
0i2 = three-voice. Every movement of the solo-voice or of the duet voices
     or of all of them is allowed, except those completing a 43,
     or forming a semitone dischord.

the solo voice can be deemed to be two voices in unison,
which can then divide, yielding 2i2

If i is even, 2e2, all +/-1 +/-1 +/-1 +/-1 are fine.
In some of those combinations it reverts back to 0e2 or 0ee

If 232,
then --++ is a flipflop causing a +/-6st change
  or ++++ and ----  are parallel movement and are fine
  or 000+ becomes a 233
  or -+-+ gives a 414 (canonicalises as 143) and they're all allowed,
     under the major-seventh-is-ok rule.
  or 00++ and --00  become a 242

If 242,
then 0000 is itself dual to it's own +/-6st transposition
  or 00-0 becomes a 233
  or -+-+ is  a flipflop +/-3 change
  or 0++0 and 0++0 and +00+ and -00- lead to 414
     and are allowed under the major-seventh rule.
  all +/-1 +/-1+/-1 +/-1 stay in the even-only domain, and are all fine.

If 414 (canonicalises as 143),
then each pair can explore 3 different heights
      because or the major-seventh rule, the middle height being a 242
  or --++ is a flipflop causing a +/-6st change

If 233,
Then -+00 is a +3st
  or -0+0 is a flipflop causing a +/-6st change
  or -00+ is a -3st
  or ++++ and ----  are parallel movement and are fine
  or 000- becomes a 232
  or 00+0 becomes a 242
  or 00-0 becomes a 224  which enters the even-only domain
  or 0-00 becomes a 143 (see 414)
  or --0- becomes a 242

Perhaps this is the organising principle of Klavieruebung II ?
with the finger-exercises as Klavieruebung I ?

The final two: Improvisation (for two pianos)
  and Composition (for two pianos, two horns and two trumpets)

For the Improvisation:
  could even record 2 hands, then overdub the other 2, then midi2muscript :-)

For the Composition:
  Could: use one piano as a Pedal with a long comb pattern
    two horns, adding 2 voices thus defining a 3-note chord
    over which the other piano and the trumpets converse, or dance
  or with that Amthem1RH_within_Anthem2LH pattern ||:20|18:||  (see AK)

Scales in // and contrary motion

  up and down an octave in 12/8 x 2, 4 sec  (100 sec)
    //: at six different intervals between the two hands,  (600 sec)
    contrary-motion: unison lower-notes at twelve different notes  (1200 sec)

20120602 voice_leading - very important... the basis of much
20120606 two_two - albertifiisation of //@@(3,4) + //@@(3,4)

Forget the big 2pno+2trp+2hrn finale ! silly idea...
end with 20121111 variations.
Second-last piece perhaps something for a solo line ?

Possible titles
  Klavieruebungen   too pretentious ?
  Harmonielehre     not bad; though excludes the simple 5-finger exercises
  Keyboard Harmony  not bad
  Piano Study       too like there was only one of them ?
  Piano Studies
  Keyboard Study    not bad
  Keyboard Studies

20121111 The final set of variations (if 'worked examples' isn't a better name)
