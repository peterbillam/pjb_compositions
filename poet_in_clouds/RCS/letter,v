Dear Musical Director,

.PP
Please find enclosed a complimentary copy of my latest work,
"The Poet in the Clouds".
I hope you will find an opportunity to look at it with your choir.
.PP
You will notice that it carries an unusual copyright message;
you may freely photocopy the score,
and may hand it out to the members of your choir,
subject to the conditions that it may not be resold for profit
(charging to cover copying cost is permitted)
and that the copyright notice remain intact at the bottom of each page.
.PP
I recommend, but do not require, that you copy double-sided onto A3 paper,
and fold into a booklet.
I recommend that you keep the enclosed copy safe,
and use it only to make further copies from.
If your copies become too blurred, or you wish to own the latest printing,
further originals may be ordered by mail from myself;
a price list is enclosed.
.PP
Note that I retain all other rights, including those of performance,
recording and broadcast.
I would be very pleased if you were to perform the work
in any of these contexts,
and, if you do, I encourage you to fulfil the necessary formalities
with the Australian Performing Rights Association.

.PP
With best wishes for yourself and your choir,
@
