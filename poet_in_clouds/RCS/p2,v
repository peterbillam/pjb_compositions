O ! it is pleasant, with a heart at ease
\ \ \ Just after sunset, or by moonlight skies,
To make the shifting clouds be what you please,
\ \ \ Or let the easily persuaded eyes
Own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould
\ \ \ Of a friend's fancy; or with head bent low
And cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold
\ \ \ 'Twixt crimson banks; and then, a traveller, go
From mount to mount through Cloudland, gorgeous land !

\ \ \ Or list'ning to the tide, with closed sight,
Be that blind bard, who on the Chian strand
\ \ \ By those deep sounds possessed with inward light,
Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssee
\ \ \ Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea.
