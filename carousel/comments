A select group knew in advance
that Oswald was to be the patsy.
Need-to-know \- perhaps Ruby, Olsen, White, the gunmen and support.
Perhaps Tippett ?
.SH
The Riddle of Officer Tippet
.LP
They probably intended Oswals and Tippet both to be shot.
The story would be taht Oswald shot Tippet while resisting arrest,
and the other policemen shot Oswald.
.LP
But Tippet didn't succeed in picking up Oswald up at his rooms;
Oswald was suspicious; on the way home he'd been thinking about
the unexpected change of assassination venue.
Tippet called in from the record store
(not wanting to use the police radio)
to say he didn't have Oswald with him,
there was an argument,
they agreed to meet, and they shot him.
.LP
The others had to think fast,
they worked out that Tippet had to go,
and they decided to keep the "Oswald kills Tippet" bit of the story.
It's important when defending a cover story
to depart from it as little as possible.
In retrospect they should have just buried the Tippet killing.
.LP
The Ruby had to kill Oswald.
They held him at the Station for as long as possible
so as to separate the two killings,
to make it look less like they were part of the same operation.
.LP
So Ruby wasn't leaning on Rose Cheramie to perform the Tippet murder,
but to be a witness saying that Oswald shot Tippet.
But she wouldn't do it \- `drug running yes, but I draw the line at murder'
\- and it was being an accessory to murder she was objecting to,
not performing it.
.LP
Rose didn't know about the plans to kill Kennedy,
but she guesses while being leaned upon \-
very unusual, to kill a cop, bad for business.
.LP
So two days before,
Ruby knows Oswald and Tippet are to be shot, and why,
and Rose Cheramie finds out.
Oswald thinks Kennedy is to be killed at the Trade Fair,
Tippet probably knows nothing.
.LP
Lot of things go wrong \-
Rose doesn't quite die, the train gets stopped,
Oswald smells a rat and hides in his bedroom so Tippet fails to pick him up.

.SH
The Change of Venue
.LP
They chose the Book Depository more than two weeks before,

.SH
The Betrayal of Ruby
.LP
Within the select group that knew in advance that Oswald was to be the patsy,
there would have to be an even more select group
which knew that Ruby was to be vilified at trial to
.IP \(bu
discredit in advance anything he might say
.IP \(bu
make sure he never got out of jail
.LP
Presumably, Marcello and Santos had undertaken
that Ruby would not leave jail alive,
and that he would be killed only after several years,
in order to avoid too close an association with the rest of the operation.
.LP
So each killing cleaned up after the previous one,
and each one much smaller than the previous,
until Ruby's death is almost silent.
