Greetings;


     I  write  to  you  to  bring to your attention a new opera,
called 'November at the Carousel', on which I have been  working
for  the last several years.  It follows the story of Jack Ruby,
from two days  before  the  assassination  of  President Kennedy
through  to  the  Warren Commission hearing six months later.  I
chose this subject from  several  alternatives  because  of  its
sustained dramatic tension, as well as its intimate relevance to
so many people.


     You will find enclosed the orchestra, the list  of  scenes,
the  cast  list,  the libretto, and three sample scenes in vocal
score form with a simplified piano accompaniment.


     The whole opera, or at least the  vocal  parts  of  it,  is
composed  more  or  less to the stage which you see in the three
sample scenes.  I expect it  to  take  two  or  three  years  to
finish,  and  the  premiere performance is still uncommitted.  I
write to you now because major opera houses tend to  plan  their
productions five or ten years in advance.


     I  am  planning  to be in England and Europe during May and
June this year, so if you feel that 'November at  the  Carousel'
could  form  part  of  your plans and that it would be useful to
discuss the matter, I hope you will make contact soon so that  a
visit can be fitted into my itinerary.


     Regards,
