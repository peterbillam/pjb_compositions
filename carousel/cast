Frontispiece

.LP
.nh
The frontispiece portrait of Jack Ruby,
and the self-portrait of the composer at the end,
were both drawn by Peter Billam directly into Postscript,
using the Postscript line-drawing subroutines
\f2www.pjb.com.au/comp/free/line_drawing.ps.txt\fP
and a text editor \f2/usr/bin/vi\fP.
The portrait of Jack Ruby was taken from his mugshot
after he had been charged with Oswald's murder.
The self-portrait of Peter Billam was taken from a
pencil sketch drawn in the mirror of the Kafé Kara in Hobart
in February 2000.
