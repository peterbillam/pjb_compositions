Greetings;

.PP

I write to you to bring to your attention a new opera,
called 'November at the Carousel',
on which I have been working for the last several years.
It follows the story of Jack Ruby,
from two days before the assassination of President Kennedy through to
the Warren Commission hearing six months later.
I chose this subject from several alternatives
because of its sustained dramatic tension,
as well as its intimate relevance to so many people.

You will find enclosed the orchestra, the list of scenes,
the cast list, the libretto, and three sample scenes in vocal score form
with a simplified piano accompaniment.

.PP

The whole opera, or at least the vocal parts of it,
is composed more or less to the stage which you see in the three sample scenes.
The vocal score is 200 pages long,
and I expect the opera to last for about two hours.
I expect it to take two or three years to finish,
and the premiere performance is still uncommitted.
I write to you now because major opera houses tend to plan their productions
five or ten years in advance.

I am planning to be in England and Europe during May and June this year,
so if you feel that 'November at the Carousel' could form part of your plans
and that it would be useful to discuss the matter,
I hope you will make contact soon so that a visit can be fitted into
my itinerary.

.PP
Regards,
