Greetings Anthony,

.PP

In 1997, while you were General Director at Glyndebourne,
I was privileged to observe several rehearsals there,
of Manon Lescaut and Owen Wingrave,
and greatly enjoyed trying to guess what the conductors would comment on,
and noting how they expressed themselves.
I find witnessing rehearsals to be very rewarding,
and owe my experiences at Glyndebourne in 1997, through Tisi, to yourself.
When you were revisiting Glyndebourne recently to see Fidelio,
my sister Rosemary talked to you about my opera 'November at the Carousel',
on which I have been working for the last several years.

It follows the story of Jack Ruby,
from two days before the assassination of President Kennedy through to
the Warren Commission hearing six months later.
I chose this subject from several alternatives
because of its sustained dramatic tension,
as well as its intimate relevance to so many people.

You will find enclosed the orchestra, the list of scenes,
the cast list, the libretto, and three sample scenes in vocal score form
with a simplified piano accompaniment.
I hope you will be able to read both the libretto and the sample scenes.

The whole opera, or at least the vocal parts of it,
is composed more or less to the stage which you see in the three sample scenes.
The vocal score is 200 pages long,
and the opera should last for about two hours.
I expect it to take two or three years to finish,
and the premiere performance is still uncommitted.
I recently posted the enclosed material out to about fifty opera houses
to bring it to their attention,
knowing that major opera houses tend to plan their productions
five or ten years in advance.
.PP

I am sure that, if staged at Dallas, November at the Carousel
would create a great deal of interest, some of it welcome.
Any helpful advice you might have about getting this work where it is aimed,
into the mainstream repertoire of opera houses across the world,
would be most gratefully received.

.PP
Regards, and best wishes for your work at the Dallas Opera,
