Go on then, Sparky, tell me what it is.

It's very easy, Rose, it's nothing at all,

What's going to happen there, Sparky ?

What you will \f3see\fP, Rose, is
there's this guy running away,

and then the guy pulls out a gun and shoots the cop.
That's what you'll see.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
What happens to the guy ?

Well, the other cops have to shoot him, don't they;
but that's OK,
because you say you saw him shoot the first cop first, didn't you.

But he didn't shoot the first cop first.

But that's murder, Sparky !

That's not murder, Rose, it's the police, it's completely legal.

I'm not getting involved with murder.

Lee, I want you to meet some friends of mine from Chicago,
Charles and Richard.
This is Lee Oswald, of the CIA .\ \ .\ \ .
Lee, my friends here need to be on the top floor of the Depository
on Friday, they need a good view, and they don't want to be disturbed.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
They need a good view ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
When the motorcade goes through Dealy Plaza,
about 12:30, whenever it is; that's the zero hour,
that's the start signal for all the rest of the operation.
These guys have the radios;
they give the timing for the whole job, at the Trade Mart, and everywhere else.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Uh-huh.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
So, you work there, and we need you to hang around in the lunch room
to make sure no-one goes up the stairs and disturbs them.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Hey, I don't even get to see the motorcade !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Oh, Lee, it's important you don't get photographed at a window.
You are one of the conspirators, after all . . .
There'll be cameras going off everywhere with the President driving past,
so you stay away from windows.
My friends just need some peace and quiet to do their work,
and then to get down the stairs and out the back afterwards.
That's why you're working in the Book Depository, Lee;
someone that won't attract attention has to guard the stairs.
You can do that, Lee ?
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Of course I can.
I guess I just wish I could be doing
something more important for the operation.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
But you are, Lee !
\f2(Cain and Nicoletti look at Ruby)\fP
I mean, in an operation with as many people as this,
everyone is given a role,
and they all fit into the plan
and in the end who knows who is the most important ?
It could turn out to be someone no-one would have expected !
Isn't that right, boys ?
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
You put that very clearly, Sparky.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Yeah . . .
O.K. now, the getaway . . .
twenty minutes after the motorcade,
Lee, you come to my place, J.D. will be there,
we wait for news from the Trade Mart,
then J.D. drives you to the plane,
and David takes you to Mexico.  O.K. ?
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
So it's your place, twenty minutes after.  O.K.

It gives you time to take the bus, just like you would normally,
nothing unusual, nothing suspicious, O.K. ?

He knows there's something he doesn't know, but he doesn't know what.

He still thinks the job's at the Trade Mart.

He's a spook.  Who knows what they think.

Who cares. I'll shoot him myself after he shoots a cop ;
J.D., in fact \f2(pause)\fP
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
That's good. \f2(smiles)\fP That's very tidy.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
We have to keep in mind the story.
The story is what's important, what must come out of all this.
The story is; Lee is a commie agent, shoots the President, O.K. ?
He kills J.D. resisting arrest, so I have to shoot him.
To look good, it's \f3nec\fPessary that he kill J.D.
So I'll do that too.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Very professional.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
We have a witness who'll say the right things.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Should have two.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
We're getting another.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
It's good. Especially if Lee co-operates\ .\ .\ .
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
Yeah. When Lee finds out it was in the Plaza instead, he'll get suspicious.
Because he betrayed the Trade Mart to the Bureau,
and he'll work out that we must have found out about that,
so he'll know he's in big trouble.
I mean, from us.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
He won't turn up at your place, Sparky.
Will he have a gun ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
He doesn't take it to work at the Bookstore.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
You're a Company man, what will he do, Rocks ?
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
He might run to the airfield on his own,
but we set up the airfield,
so most likely he'll go to his meeting place and just wait for a contact.
For him, that's the Texas Cinema, in Jefferson Boulevard.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
He'll go home, pick up the gun.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Where's his home ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
On the way to the cinema.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Well, then.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
That's where he'll go. Is he being followed ?
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
Sure, we've got Mary Bledsoe on the bus;
he knows her, but she's just an old landlady,
she runs a Company house, she's beyond suspicion.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
So if he does get off the bus, I'll send J.D. to pick him up at home,
give him a lift; he might take it.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
If he goes to the cinema; well preferably he shoots a cop there;
if not, we have to arrest him, and Jack will have to shoot him later.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Why arrest him ? It's so messy. Why not just shoot him straight away ?
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
\f3No\fP, this is not Dealey Plaza, this is \f3aft\fPerwards,
this is not the job, it's the cover-up.
It has to look good.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
But it looks great ! He just shot a cop !
I mean you \f3are\fP going to do that anyway, aren't you ?
J.D.'s so stupid and he knows so much\ .\ .\ .
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
Sure, J.D. must get hit, 'cause that's part of the story,
and we have to stick to the story.
But that's not at the cinema.
We can't shoot Lee just because he's a murder suspect !
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
You can't shoot him why ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
My friend, we can all remember things which didn't look good,
but that wasn't Lee Oswald.
This one has to look good, we understand that.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
So make him shoot a cop.
Corner him, give him targets, spin it out, he'll crack.
He's a spook but he's only a jerk.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
Alright. So, Gentlemen, this is what we have .\ .\ .\ \ 
If Lee is with J.D., I shoot them; that's the simplest.
If they're separated, I shoot J.D. anyway, he's too stupid to live.
Then we corner Lee.
Then it depends. If Lee shoots a cop, we shoot him, and that's great,
I mean that's the story, what more d'you want\ ?  \f2(they laugh)\fP
So we spin it out, but if Lee doesn't shoot a cop, we have to arrest him;
then Jack will kill him before he talks in public.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Could all come down to you, Sparky.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I'll be there !
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
More than be there, Sparky.
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
You're the last in line, Jack.
If he crosses that line and opens his mouth, \-
I don't want to think about that,
I don't even want to think about that\ !
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
This is one you have to guarantee, Jack.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I guarantee that job, he won't get past me. What' you on about ?
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Good. \f2(pause)\fP
Hey, this is hard work, this planning.
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
This is the hardest job I ever been on \-
when your own President is a security risk,
doesn't get any bigger than this\ .\ .\ .
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Two days to go, and we'll all be heroes, with friends in power.

Maybe three or four days if Sparky has to clean up the patsy.

round the corner into the garage, you just wait there behind the corner.

But this way you're hiding behind the corner !

Don't you tell me how to do it !
You fucking baby !  You ever been up close\ ?  You can't do it !
Three shots !
Stomach, heart, head, from the left side, angled downwards.

The stomach shot is great.
You line it up right, it goes through everything that's in there,
spleen, liver, kidney,
it's fatal on its own, it hurts like hell \- it's a speciality.
Sometimes you just leave them to die like that.

Then the shot to the heart goes through both lungs too,
then the head bows forward you can line the whole thing up
from the top to the brainstem with just one shot.
You must time it right, so the gun's in place just as the head comes down.

And to do that, you must see it,
you must see the insides,
the secret of being up close is to \f3see\fP the \f3insides\fP,
you line them up, you shoot \f3through\fP them.
You must see it before it happens,
before you start moving, you see the whole thing,
so fucking clearly that it takes place be\f3cause\fP you've seen it.
So don't try to tell me which fucking side to come from,
you don't know the first thing about it !

I'm behind the newsmen, behind the lights;
as he turns right, he'll want to look right, away from the lights.

he won't even see me till I'm up close and stomach, heart, head.

OK, we'll make sure the crowd's not too tight \-

Your honour, my client pleads not guilty by reason of insanity.

he did it on prime time T.V..
The bullet passed through the left lung, the spleen,
both the vena cava and the aorta, the two major blood vessels in the abdomen,
the liver, and the right kidney.
It was a freak, lucky shot, a freak shot, but a woeful wound,
inflicted by a violent man, a man with a long history of violence,
a man subject to uncontrollable rages.
