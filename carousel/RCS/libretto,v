Sparky, I need to go to the bathroom, and they won't let me.

I bet you're looking forward to Louisiana, Rose !
Been tough, the last few weeks,
you'll have a good time when you get there, I know.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
I just taste to see if it's good, I don't mess around.

You do a good job for Houston, Rose,
you always get the stuff there;

Can I go to the bathroom ?

But before you go to Louisiana, Rose,
there's one extra little thing we need you to do this time. \f2(pause)\fP

Go on then, Sparky, tell me what it is.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
It's very easy, Rose, it's nothing at all,
you don't even have to \f3do\fP anything,
you just \f3be\fP there at the right time.

What's going to happen there, Sparky ?

What you will \f3see\fP, Rose, is
there's this guy running away,
and then a cop calls out to him,
and then the guy pulls out a gun and shoots the cop.
That's what you'll see.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
What happens to the guy ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Well, the other cops have to shoot him, don't they;
but that's OK,
because you say you saw him shoot the first cop first, didn't you.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
But he didn't shoot the first cop first.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
That's OK, because you're a witness, Rose,
and you tell them that he \f3did\fP shoot the first cop first.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
But that's murder, Sparky !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
That's not murder, Rose, it's the police, it's completely legal.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
I'm not getting involved with murder.

Rose, it's only a lie, you tell them all the time.

That the guy is supposed to have shot ? \f2(pause)\fP
Do they shoot him too ?  Shit, Sparky !

Look, Rose, to go to Louisiana I need someone I can trust.
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
I'll run drugs for you, Sparky, but I draw the line at murder !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Listen here, Rose\ ! or you'll not be running drugs for me no more,
\'cause I need someone I can \f3trust\fP, Rose,
someone who can \f3do\fP what needs to be \f3done\fP\ !
What is this, bitch\ ?  You're a junkie\ !
A junkie, and all of a sudden you can't tell a lie\ ?  What is this\ !
.IP \f2Rose\fP 2c
\f2(pause)\fP I'm sorry, I can't do this, Sparky,
not with murder, it's different.  Try Helen . . .
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Helen's a screwball, Rose, no-one would believe her.
Look, this is so easy for you, it's not murder,
you just \f3say\fP you \f3saw\fP the \f3guy\fP \f3shoot\fP the \f3cop\fP.
\f2(pause)\fP Listen here, Rose \- if you can't do this, if you can't do this thing,
that means we can't work together any more, Rose.
Is that what you want ?

\f2(crying)\fP I \f3can\fP't do it, not murder, I can't \f3do\fP that.  Maybe Helen will.

Bitch !

Too highly strung.  Do the goons know she needs an accident now ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I told them.  Another junkie that will never tell a lie again !

Hey, Jack, in a job like this,
if we can't arrange a little perjury we're going to look pretty stupid.

This is your Master of Ceremonies, Jack Ruby,

Ruby, Oswald, Cain, Nicoletti, and White are sitting round a table.\fP
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Lee, I want you to meet some friends of mine from Chicago,
Charles and Richard.
This is Lee Oswald, of the CIA .\ \ .\ \ .
Lee, my friends here need to be on the top floor of the Depository
on Friday, they need a good view, and they don't want to be disturbed.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
They need a good view ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
When the motorcade goes through Dealy Plaza,
about 12:30, whenever it is; that's the zero hour,
that's the start signal for all the rest of the operation.
These guys have the radios;
they give the timing for the whole job, at the Trade Mart, and everywhere else.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Uh-huh.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
So, you work there, and we need you to hang around in the lunch room
to make sure no-one goes up the stairs and disturbs them.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Hey, I don't even get to see the motorcade !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Oh, Lee, it's important you don't get photographed at a window.
You are one of the conspirators, after all . . .
There'll be cameras going off everywhere with the President driving past,
so you stay away from windows.
My friends just need some peace and quiet to do their work,
and then to get down the stairs and out the back afterwards.
That's why you're working in the Book Depository, Lee;
someone that won't attract attention has to guard the stairs.
You can do that, Lee ?
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Of course I can.
I guess I just wish I could be doing
something more important for the operation.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
But you are, Lee !
\f2(Cain and Nicoletti look at Ruby)\fP
I mean, in an operation with as many people as this,
everyone is given a role,
and they all fit into the plan
and in the end who knows who is the most important ?
It could turn out to be someone no-one would have expected !
Isn't that right, boys ?
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
You put that very clearly, Sparky.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Yeah . . .
O.K. now, the getaway . . .
twenty minutes after the motorcade,
Lee, you come to my place, J.D. will be there,
we wait for news from the Trade Mart,
then J.D. drives you to the plane,
and David takes you to Mexico.  O.K. ?
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
So it's your place, twenty minutes after.  O.K.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
It gives you time to take the bus, just like you would normally,
nothing unusual, nothing suspicious, O.K. ?
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
O.K.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Hey, Beverly, \f2(beckons)\fP come over here and meet my friends !
Beverly, these are friends of mine from Chicago
I want you to make feel real welcome in Dallas.
Beverly sings at the Colony Club next door.
You know Lee, don't you.
Hey, Lynne \f2(beckons)\fP, 
Lynne, this is Lee Oswald of the CIA, I know you'll like him,
and some friends of mine from Chicago.
.IP \f2Lynne\fP 2c
Delighted to meet you, Lee.
.IP \f2Oswald\fP 2c
Likewise, maam.
.IP \f2Lynne\fP 2c
Hey Roscoe, where's Geneva ?
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
Ah, Geneva can't be here, she ain't feeling well.
.IP \f2Lynne\fP 2c
Hey Sparky, is Rose around ?
I feel like having a really good time !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I'll fix you up, Lynne.
Poor Rose, she wasn't feeling so good, she couldn't even see straight,
I had to give her the day off.
.IP \f2Lynne\fP 2c
Oh Sparky, you're so good to your girls !
And you C.I.A. heroes, you're so strong and mysterious,
you know so many things,
I bet there's things you could tell me I don't even know yet\ .\ .\ .

I don't think so, maam.

So what d'you think of the patsy ?
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
He's a jerk.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Tense.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
He's a spook, but he's a jerk.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
He knows there's something he doesn't know, but he doesn't know what.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
He still thinks the job's at the Trade Mart.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
He's a spook.  Who knows what they think.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
Who cares. I'll shoot him myself after he shoots a cop ;
J.D., in fact \f2(pause)\fP
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
That's good. \f2(smiles)\fP That's very tidy.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
We have to keep in mind the story.
The story is what's important, what must come out of all this.
The story is; Lee is a commie agent, shoots the President, O.K. ?
He kills J.D. resisting arrest, so I have to shoot him.
To look good, it's \f3nec\fPessary that he kill J.D.
So I'll do that too.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Very professional.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
We have a witness who'll say the right things.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Should have two.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
We're getting another.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
It's good. Especially if Lee co-operates\ .\ .\ .
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
Yeah. When Lee finds out it was in the Plaza instead, he'll get suspicious.
Because he betrayed the Trade Mart to the Bureau,
and he'll work out that we must have found out about that,
so he'll know he's in big trouble.
I mean, from us.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
He won't turn up at your place, Sparky.
Will he have a gun ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
He doesn't take it to work at the Bookstore.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
You're a Company man, what will he do, Rocks ?
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
He might run to the airfield on his own,
but we set up the airfield,
so most likely he'll go to his meeting place and just wait for a contact.
For him, that's the Texas Cinema, in Jefferson Boulevard.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
He'll go home, pick up the gun.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Where's his home ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
On the way to the cinema.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Well, then.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
That's where he'll go. Is he being followed ?
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
Sure, we've got Mary Bledsoe on the bus;
he knows her, but she's just an old landlady,
she runs a Company house, she's beyond suspicion.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
So if he does get off the bus, I'll send J.D. to pick him up at home,
give him a lift; he might take it.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
If he goes to the cinema; well preferably he shoots a cop there;
if not, we have to arrest him, and Jack will have to shoot him later.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Why arrest him ? It's so messy. Why not just shoot him straight away ?
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
\f3No\fP, this is not Dealey Plaza, this is \f3aft\fPerwards,
this is not the job, it's the cover-up.
It has to look good.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
But it looks great ! He just shot a cop !
I mean you \f3are\fP going to do that anyway, aren't you ?
J.D.'s so stupid and he knows so much\ .\ .\ .
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
Sure, J.D. must get hit, 'cause that's part of the story,
and we have to stick to the story.
But that's not at the cinema.
We can't shoot Lee just because he's a murder suspect !
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
You can't shoot him why ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
My friend, we can all remember things which didn't look good,
but that wasn't Lee Oswald.
This one has to look good, we understand that.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
So make him shoot a cop.
Corner him, give him targets, spin it out, he'll crack.
He's a spook but he's only a jerk.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
Alright. So, Gentlemen, this is what we have .\ .\ .\ \ 
If Lee is with J.D., I shoot them; that's the simplest.
If they're separated, I shoot J.D. anyway, he's too stupid to live.
Then we corner Lee.
Then it depends. If Lee shoots a cop, we shoot him, and that's great,
I mean that's the story, what more d'you want\ ?  \f2(they laugh)\fP
So we spin it out, but if Lee doesn't shoot a cop, we have to arrest him;
then Jack will kill him before he talks in public.
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Could all come down to you, Sparky.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I'll be there !
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
More than be there, Sparky.
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
You're the last in line, Jack.
If he crosses that line and opens his mouth, \-
I don't want to think about that,
I don't even want to think about that\ !
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
This is one you have to guarantee, Jack.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I guarantee that job, he won't get past me. What' you on about ?
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Good. \f2(pause)\fP
Hey, this is hard work, this planning.
.IP \f2White\fP 2c
This is the hardest job I ever been on \-
when your own President is a security risk,
doesn't get any bigger than this\ .\ .\ .
.IP \f2Cain\fP 2c
Two days to go, and we'll all be heroes, with friends in power.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
Maybe three or four days if Sparky has to clean up the patsy.
You gonna be O.K., Sparky ?
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
I take care of myself.
.IP \f2Nicoletti\fP 2c
I'm sure you do.

Oswald is near the back row in the centre,

John Brewer points Oswald out to the police.

Act Two, Scene Three; Inside Olsen's Car
.LP
\f2(CONS 481, MKPK 169) The car is parked in the courtyard of Simon's Garage,
about one o'clock on Saturday morning,
with Olsen in the driver's seat and Kathy in the back.
Kathy spots Ruby outside and waves at him;
Ruby comes over and gets in the front passenger's seat.\fP
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Is she in on this ?
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
She is here as a witness, she is trusted,
she will not intervene, but what she hears, others hear.
This is not just between us two, Jack, not just between us three.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
So what the fuck happened ?
He pulled the gun and didn't shoot ?
Why didn't he pull the trigger ?
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
He did pull the trigger !
But it didn't go off, Nick put his hand up and got it stuck in the firing pin !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
What ! Ah, shit ! Lucky like that should be illegal.
But he tried to shoot, you could have shot him anyway.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
So could you, Jack, but the plan was if he didn't shoot a cop we arrest him
and that's what happened.  \f2(pause)\fP
There's always some lucky ones.
Always some lucky ones;
your goons pushed Rose out the car and guess what,
now she's in hospital and expected to live.

Nah, the next time, they shoot her in the head first !

Yeah. Then run over the head ! It looks better ! \f2(they laugh. Kathy seems upset.)\fP
So now where is the son of a bitch ?

But that wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald.
This is different.  We can't do this one.
This is part of the cover-up, not part of the operation,

We can't do this one, Jack, you have to do it.

Oh, so it's OK if the heat avoid suspicion
provided it falls on my family, huh\ ?

But the son of a bitch is surrounded by cops !
Reduce suspicion ?
You think I'm supposed to wander in and kill him and it not look suspicious ?

It's easy; we bring in the newsmen and the T.V. !

On Sunday morning, we transfer him to the County Jail,

It looks like you came in with the newsmen,

.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
So this is how we do it.
Oswald comes out of the office, he turns right,
round the corner into the garage, you just wait there behind the corner.
Point-blank range, you never have to move, he just walks into it.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
That's no good ! I have to come at him from his left side.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
But this way you're hiding behind the corner !
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Don't you tell me how to do it !
You fucking baby !  You ever been up close\ ?  You can't do it !
Three shots !
Stomach, heart, head, from the left side, angled downwards.

The stomach shot is great.
You line it up right, it goes through everything that's in there,
spleen, liver, kidney,
it's fatal on its own, it hurts like hell \- it's a speciality.
Sometimes you just leave them to die like that.

Then the shot to the heart goes through both lungs too,
then the head bows forward you can line the whole thing up
from the top to the brainstem with just one shot.
You must time it right, so the gun's in place just as the head comes down.

And to do that, you must see it,
you must see the insides,
the secret of being up close is to \f3see\fP the \f3insides\fP,
you line them up, you shoot \f3through\fP them.
You must see it before it happens,
before you start moving, you see the whole thing,
so fucking clearly that it takes place be\f3cause\fP you've seen it.
So don't try to tell me which fucking side to come from,
you don't know the first thing about it !
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
\f2(pause)\fP\  OK, Jack, you come at his left side.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Make sure the T.V. lights are in his eyes straight away.
I'm behind the newsmen, behind the lights;
as he turns right, he'll want to look right, away from the lights.
Then I push through the crowd;
he won't even see me till I'm up close and stomach, heart, head.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
OK, we'll make sure the crowd's not too tight \-
security reasons\ .\ .\ . \f2(smiles)\fP
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Then everybody jumps on top and beats the shit out of me.

No, Jack, out of him ! \f2(they laugh\fP)
You're not in this alone, Jack. \f2(pause)\fP
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Hey.  This mustn't look premeditated at all,
from my point of view, I mean,
cause that would make it murder !
This has to look spontaneous, just a violent fit of rage.
.IP \f2Olsen\fP 2c
They'll believe that of you, Jack.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Don't make fun of me, Harry !
Tom Howard told me, he's a good man, he hasn't lost a client yet.

Chief Justice Warren, I am used as a scapegoat.
But if I am eliminated, there won't be any way of knowing.
Maybe something can be saved, something can be done;
what have you got to answer to that, Chief Justice Warren ? (\f2pause\fP)
Right now, I am the only one who can bring out the truth to our President . . .
Does that make sense to you ?  \f2(pause)\fP
Now maybe certain people don't want to know the truth that may come out of me.

It will be in permanent form for the President of the United States

Well, Mr Ruby, is there anything more you feel you should tell us ?
I think if I was in your position I would figure it out very carefully
as to whether it would endanger me or not.
I want you to feel that you are absolutely free
to refrain from testifying any time you wish.
.IP \f2Ruby\fP 2c
Gentlemen, if you want to hear any further testimony,
you will have to get me to Washington, \f3soon\fP,

we have no place \f3there\fP for you to be safe \- when we take you out \- ,
