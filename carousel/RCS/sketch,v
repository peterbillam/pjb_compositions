r0.4                  well don't go home yet !

r0.4                  the most sophisticated, the most risque\*',
d1219 1

r0.4                  the most provocative, the most delightful.
d1224 1

d1229 2

r0.4                  Ruby, Oswald, Cain, Nicoletti, and White are sitting round a table.
d1269 1
a1269 1
r0.4                  Lee, I want you to meet some friends of mine from Chicago,
d1274 1
a1274 1
r0.4                  Charles and Richard.
d1279 1
a1279 1
r0.4                  This is Lee Oswald, of the CIA .  .  .
d1284 1
a1284 1
r0.4                  Lee, my friends here need to be on the top floor of the Depository
d1289 1
a1289 1
r0.4                  on Friday, they need a good view, and they don't want to be disturbed.
d1295 1
a1295 1
r0.4                  They need a good view ?
d1302 1
a1302 1
r0.4                  When the motorcade goes through Dealy Plaza,
d1307 1
a1307 1
r0.4                  about 12:30, whenever it is; that's the zero hour,
d1312 1
a1312 1
r0.4                  that's the start signal for all the rest of the operation.
d1317 1
a1317 1
r0.4                  These guys have the radios;
d1322 1
a1322 1
r0.4                  they give the timing for the whole job, at the Trade Mart, and everywhere else.
d1328 1
a1328 1
r0.4                  Uh-huh.
d1334 1
a1334 1
r0.4                  So, you work there, and we need you to hang around in the lunch room
d1339 1
a1339 1
r0.4                  to make sure no-one goes up the stairs and disturbs them.
d1345 1
a1345 1
r0.4                  Hey, I don't even get to see the motorcade !
d1351 1
a1351 1
r0.4                  Oh, Lee, it's important you don't get photographed at a window.
d1356 1
a1356 1
r0.4                  You are one of the conspirators, after all . . .
d1361 2
a1362 1
r0.4                  There'll be cameras going off everywhere with the President driving past,
d1369 1
a1369 1
r0.4                  so you stay away from windows.
d1374 1
a1374 1
r0.4                  My friends just need some peace and quiet to do their work,
d1379 1
a1379 1
r0.4                  and then to get down the stairs and out the back afterwards.
d1384 1
a1384 1
r0.4                  That's why you're working in the Book Depository, Lee;
d1389 1
a1389 1
r0.4                  someone that won't attract attention has to guard the stairs.
d1394 1
a1394 1
r0.4                  You can do that, Lee ?
d1400 1
a1400 1
r0.4                  Of course I can.
d1405 1
a1405 1
r0.4                  I guess I just wish I could be doing
d1410 1
a1410 1
r0.4                  something more important for the operation.
d1416 1
a1416 1
r0.4                  But you are, Lee !
d1421 1
a1421 1
r0.4                  \(Cain and Nicoletti look at Ruby\)
d1426 2
a1427 1
r0.4                  I mean, in an operation with as many people as this,
d1434 1
a1434 1
r0.4                  everyone is given a role,
d1439 1
a1439 1
r0.4                  and they all fit into the plan
d1444 1
a1444 1
r0.4                  and in the end who knows who is the most important ?
d1449 1
a1449 1
r0.4                  It could turn out to be someone no-one would have expected !
d1454 1
a1454 1
r0.4                  Isn't that right, boys ?
d1460 1
a1460 1
r0.4                  You put that very clearly, Sparky.
d1466 1
a1466 1
r0.4                  Yeah . . .
d1471 1
a1471 1
r0.4                  O.K. now, the getaway . . .
d1476 1
a1476 1
r0.4                  twenty minutes after the motorcade,
d1481 1
a1481 1
r0.4                  Lee you come to my place, J.D. will be there,
d1486 1
a1486 1
r0.4                  we wait for news from the Trade Mart,
d1491 2
a1492 1
r0.4                  then J.D. drives you to the plane,
d1499 1
a1499 1
r0.4                  and David takes you to Mexico.  O.K. ?
d1505 1
a1505 1
r0.4                  So it's your place, twenty minutes after.
d1511 1
a1511 1
r0.4                  It gives you time to take the bus, just like you would normally,
d1516 1
a1516 1
r0.4                  nothing unusual, nothing suspicious, O.K. ?
d1522 1
a1522 1
r0.4                  O.K.
d1528 1
a1528 1
r0.4                  Hey, Beverly, \(beckons\) come over here and meet my friends !
d1533 1
a1533 1
r0.4                  Beverly, these are friends of mine from Chicago
d1538 1
a1538 1
r0.4                  I want you to make feel real welcome in Dallas.
d1543 1
a1543 1
r0.4                  Beverly sings at the Colony Club next door,
d1548 1
a1548 1
r0.4                  You know Lee, don't you.
d1553 1
a1553 1
r0.4                  Hey, Lynne \(beckons\), 
d1558 2
a1559 1
r0.4                  Lynne, this is Lee Oswald of the CIA, I know you'll like him,
d1566 1
a1566 1
r0.4                  and some friends of mine from Chicago.
d1572 1
a1572 1
r0.4                  Delighted to meet you, Lee.
d1578 1
a1578 1
r0.4                  Likewise, maam.
d1584 1
a1584 1
r0.4                  Hey Roscoe, where's Geneva ?
d1590 1
a1590 1
r0.4                  Ah, Geneva can't be here, she got took real poorly.
d1596 1
a1596 1
r0.4                  Hey Sparky, is Rose around ?
d1601 1
a1601 1
r0.4                  I feel like having a really good time !
d1607 1
a1607 1
r0.4                  I'll fix you up, Lynne.
d1612 1
a1612 1
r0.4                  Poor Rose, she wasn't feeling so good, she couldn't even see straight,
d1617 1
a1617 1
r0.4                  I had to give her the day off.
d1623 1
a1623 1
r0.4                  Oh Sparky, you're so good to your girls !
d1628 2
a1629 1
r0.4                  And you C.I.A. heroes, you're so strong and mysterious,
d1636 1
a1636 1
r0.4                  you know so many things,
d1641 1
a1641 1
r0.4                  I bet there's things you could tell me I don't even know yet . . .
d1652 1
a1652 1
r0.4                  The club lights are dimmed, leaving just this table illuminated.
d1657 1
a1657 1
r0.4                  Ruby, Cain, Nicoletti, Olsen, White.
d1663 1
a1663 1
r0.4                  So what d'you think of the patsy ?
d1669 1
a1669 1
r0.4                  He's a jerk.
d1675 1
a1675 1
r0.4                  Tense.
d1681 1
a1681 1
r0.4                  He will die happy at least.
d1687 1
a1687 1
r0.4                  He knows there's something he doesn't know, but he doesn't know what.
d1693 1
a1693 1
r0.4                  He still thinks the job's at the Trade Mart.
d1699 2
a1700 1
r0.4                  He's a spook.  Who knows what they think.
d1708 1
a1708 1
r0.4                  Who cares.  I'll shoot him myself after he shoots a cop ;
d1713 1
a1713 1
r0.4                  J.D., in fact \(pause\)
d1719 1
a1719 1
r0.4                  That's good. \(smiles\) That's very tidy.
d1725 1
a1725 1
r0.4                  We have to keep in mind the story.
d1730 1
a1730 1
r0.4                  The story is what's important, what must come out of all this.
d1735 1
a1735 1
r0.4                  The story is; Lee is a commie agent, shoots the President, O.K. ?
d1740 1
a1740 1
r0.4                  He kills J.D. resisting arrest, so I have to shoot him.
d1745 1
a1745 1
r0.4                  To look good, it's necessary that he kill J.D.
d1750 1
a1750 1
r0.4                  So I'll do that too.
d1756 1
a1756 1
r0.4                  Very professional.
d1762 1
a1762 1
r0.4                  We have a witness who'll say the right things.
d1768 2
a1769 1
r0.4                  Should have two.
d1777 1
a1777 1
r0.4                  We're getting another.
d1783 1
a1783 1
r0.4                  It's good. Especially if Lee co-operates . . .
d1789 1
a1789 1
r0.4                  Yeah. When Lee finds out it was in the Plaza instead, he'll get suspicious.
d1794 1
a1794 1
r0.4                  Because he betrayed the Trade Mart to the Bureau,
d1799 1
a1799 1
r0.4                  and he'll work out that we must have found out about that,
d1804 1
a1804 1
r0.4                  so he'll know he's in big trouble.
d1809 1
a1809 1
r0.4                  I mean, from us.
d1815 1
a1815 1
r0.4                  He won't turn up at your place, Sparky.
d1820 1
a1820 1
r0.4                  Will he have a gun ?
d1826 1
a1826 1
r0.4                  He doesn't take it to work at the Bookstore.
d1832 1
a1832 1
r0.4                  You're a Company man, what will he do, Rocks ?
d1838 2
a1839 1
r0.4                  He might run to the airfield on his own,
d1846 1
a1846 1
r0.4                  but we set up the airfield,
d1851 1
a1851 1
r0.4                  so most likely he'll go to his meeting place and just wait for a contact.
d1856 1
a1856 1
r0.4                  For him, that's the Texas Cinema, in Jefferson Boulevard.
d1862 1
a1862 1
r0.4                  He'll go home, pick up the gun.
d1868 1
a1868 1
r0.4                  Where's his home ?
d1874 1
a1874 1
r0.4                  On the way to the cinema.
d1880 1
a1880 1
r0.4                  Well, then.
d1886 1
a1886 1
r0.4                  That's where he'll go. Is he being followed ?
d1892 1
a1892 1
r0.4                  Sure, we've got Mary Bledsoe on the bus;
d1897 1
a1897 1
r0.4                  he knows her, but she's just an old landlady,
d1902 1
a1902 1
r0.4                  she runs a Company house, she's beyond suspicion.
d1908 2
a1909 1
r0.4                  So if he does get off the bus, I'll send J.D. to pick him up at home,
d1916 1
a1916 1
r0.4                  give him a lift; he might take it.
d1922 1
a1922 1
r0.4                  If he goes to the cinema; well preferably he shoots a cop there;
d1927 1
a1927 1
r0.4                  if not, we have to arrest him, and Jack will have to shoot him later.
d1933 1
a1933 1
r0.4                  Why arrest him ? It's so messy. Why not just shoot him straight away ?
d1939 1
a1939 1
r0.4                  No, this is not Dealey Plaza, this is afterwards,
d1944 1
a1944 1
r0.4                  this is not the job, it's the cover-up.
d1949 1
a1949 1
r0.4                  It has to look good.
d1955 1
a1955 1
r0.4                  But it looks great ! He just shot a cop !
d1960 1
a1960 1
r0.4                  I mean you are going to do that anyway, aren't you ?
d1965 1
a1965 1
r0.4                  J.D.'s so stupid and he knows so much . . .
d1971 1
a1971 1
r0.4                  Sure, J.D. must get hit, 'cause that's part of the story,
d1976 2
a1977 1
r0.4                  and we have to stick to the story.
d1984 1
a1984 1
r0.4                  But that's not at the cinema.
d1989 1
a1989 1
r0.4                  We can't shoot Lee just because he's a murder suspect !
d1995 1
a1995 1
r0.4                  You can't shoot him why ?
d2001 1
a2001 1
r0.4                  My friend, we can all remember things which didn't look good,
d2006 1
a2006 1
r0.4                  but that wasn't Lee Oswald.
d2011 1
a2011 1
r0.4                  This one has to look good, we understand that.
d2017 1
a2017 1
r0.4                  So make him shoot a cop.
d2022 1
a2022 1
r0.4                  Corner him, give him targets, spin it out, he'll crack.
d2027 1
a2027 1
r0.4                  He's a spook but he's only a jerk.
d2033 1
a2033 1
r0.4                  Alright. So, Gentlemen, this is what we have . . .  
d2038 1
a2038 1
r0.4                  If Lee is with J.D., I shoot them; that's the simplest.
d2043 2
a2044 1
r0.4                  If they're separated, I shoot J.D. anyway, he's too stupid to live.
d2051 1
a2051 1
r0.4                  Then we corner Lee.
d2056 1
a2056 1
r0.4                  Then it depends. If Lee shoots a cop, we shoot him, and that's great,
d2061 1
