--------------------------- 1a ----------------------
All the life of the world                    earth
A billion years of birth and breath
And love, and food, and fear and death
Of leaf and tooth                            birth

All the life of all the years of the world
Is dying here before our eyes
Dies before our eyes

world hurled furled pearled swirled twirled

We who mourn
Who mourn the long ages
Mourn the young born

We who mourn the seas,
Who mourn the last heart, the last head, the last wing,
Mourn the last trees

O we who mourn
We mourn our lonely world,
We mourn the long ages,
We mourn the new born

We mourn the seas
We mourn the trees
We mourn the blood, the leaves,
We mourn the last heart, leaf or wing


Every harvest, every home
Every tenon, every
Every      , every poem

---------------------------- III --------------------------
drifting apart on an ocean of time and space
suddenly tumbling over the edge of the world
with only the echo of a scream

The only known,
lonely by light years

we who mourn mourn alone

We mourn the empty light years,
We cry the light years we are away
From our neighbour star

We cry across the empty light years
around our lonely world
We mourn not long, but deep,
For we will die barren, on barren land;
We too will soon be gone

We who mourn mourn alone,
Lonely by light years
The only life known.
We will not mourn long,
We mourn deep
We will soon be gone.


----------------- V -----------------
O why or who will die we leave to you
who fly, who flew, bomb to target dry of eye
We who grieve,
All who mourn,
We who grieve will not grieve long

For we who grieve who gather here in song
Our every tear is target for a bomb

Here there is work for the warlords of the world
The preachers and drovers
The bombers and bulldozers
The dealers and gun-runners

While they who rejoice exult
They bombed the millions and thought it good


When the last bulldozer runs out of oil
as it grinds the last bone to sand in the land of anger

Then the last of the flock wanders lost

                     between
AK47 and M16

sneering eyes
snarling believers
dribbling bigots

Faith in falsehood
Belief in delusion

Then the last of the snarling believers has run out of bullets,
or water, or blood

And we who grieve will gather here to mourn
All those who saw that evil dawn
And were no longer here by evening
We mourn the young
We mourn for man and woman joined

When the only positive emotion is nostalgia
Just dance, play and sing; don't think about those things.

The snarling believer who wrought all the slaughter exult in their bunkers

While we remain to mourn,
maybe not long, but deep,

--------------- VI ----------------------

The earth is no longer young
an old lady
skinned and left out in the sun


----------------- IIIX -----------------------
For we too will die barren, on barren land,
We the last in the universe,
We too will soon be gone
We bemoan the gloom of this sad goodbye

Born under sun and star




====================== Final Versions =========================

---------- I ------------ 90 cro/min
We who mourn
We gather here in song
We gather here to mourn
All the life of the world, all the flesh and wood of earth
A billion years of sun and breath,
And love and food, and fear and death,
All the life of the ages, every dawn and every birth
We gather here to mourn

---------- II ------------ 112 cro/min
We grieve to lose what we achieved.
We grieve for love of word and number, pen and poem;
We sing of bow and string, cloth and home,
We sing for love of book and dance and poet,
Of every rope, every tenon, every boat;
For what we made and sang and thought and built and wrote.
Before the rain and tide
Wash these pages from our empty rooms and feed them to the ocean,
We gather here to grieve.

---------- III ------------ 72 cro/min
Lonely in the light years around our only world,
The only known;
Cold far light years that bear no song of ours.
We who mourn alone mourn deep.
We who mourn will not mourn long;
We too will soon be gone.

---------- III ------------ 72 cro/min
The long light years
round our only world,
cold and far,
they bear no song.

We mourn alone,
mourn our lonely world,
mourn deep,
will soon be gone.

We will not mourn long;
the long light years
will bear no song.

2 Anger - We killed it knowingly, pretending not to know  (five voices)

------------- IV ---------------
(solo voice, 3 voices in 2-note phrases upbeat->downbeat, 5/4 an 4/4

And we knew,
 we knew,
for generations we knew,
 but what use ?
Some leather-lunged adventurer,
 fist on steering wheel;
 he held the levers,
He didn't listen to the shouting from the back seat.
We could see;
 everyone could see;
We knew.
We saw it coming, he kept on driving, it came.

#How clever !
#We wove the rope and tied the noose.
#How hard we worked
# to build the cars that killed us,
#We brewed that poison
# and all the time we knew it was for us !
#How clever !

We worked so hard,
 we wove the rope,
 we brewed the poison,
 and all the time we knew it was for us !

----------------- V ------------------ (five voices)
(solo voice, 3 voices in 2-note phrases upbeat->downbeat, 4/4 an 3/4

Here is the work of warlords,
dealers and preachers,
believers and gun-runners,
who wrought this slaughter.   # from their bunkers.
Who will die, we leave to you,
who flew, who fly, bomb to victim dry of eye.

With the final fighter out of bullets, water or blood,
when the last of the flock wanders lost,
when the bulldozer grinding bones to sand runs out of oil,

then we will gather here to mourn
all those who saw that evil dawn
and were no longer here by evening.
# We mourn man and woman joined;
# mourn their young.
While we remain, we mourn deep; not long.

----------------- VI ------------------ (four voices)
(solo voice, 3 voices in 2-note phrases upbeat->downbeat, 3/4 an 2/4

 VI   2c We pretended not to know

Who me ? I didn't know !
They all agree !
No-one told me...

No-one told me eighty years ago,
forty nor twenty,
ten nor five;
only business as usual.
# There was no danger, just business as usual.

No-one told me !
All agree !
I didn't know,
not me...

=====================OLD VERSIONS===================

---  IV first version ---

We knew for generations,
but what use ?
The leather-lunged adventurer,
fist on steering wheel,
held the levers,
didn't listen to the shouting from the back seat.
We could see;
everyone could see.
We knew.
We saw it coming, we kept on driving, and it came.

How hard we work ! how clever !    # VI ?
We wove the rope and tied the noose.
How hard we work ! how clever !
We built the cars that killed us,
we brewed the poison;
and all the time we knew
it was for us.

--- V first version ---

We sing, and every note is target for a bomb.

Here is work for the warlords,
the preachers and dealers,
and bombers and gun-runners.
Snarling believers
who wrought this slaughter
exult in their bunkers.
Who will die, we leave to you,
you who flew, who fly, bomb to target dry of eye;

When the final believer has run out of bullets, or water, or blood,
and the last of their flock wanders lost,
when the bulldozer grinding the bones to sand
runs out of oil,

Then we will gather here to mourn
all those who saw that evil dawn
and were no longer here by evening.
We mourn for man and woman joined;
we mourn their young.

While we remain, we mourn,
not long, but deep.
