well I never knew a Tedious June or a Room with a Tree
nor a Tomb with a Key or a Seed on the Moon

well I never saw the Car of a Whore with the Door left aJar
nor a Farm with a Brawl on the Floor of the Barn

well I never found a Way for a Purr to be Heard in the Bay
but the Bird to reMain there to Play in the Fur

well I never did beLieve there's a Flaw in the Law of the Sea
nor a Horn in the Weeds at the Feet of the Poor 
 
well I never knew the Rune of a Lay or the Pay of a Fool
nor of May coming Soon  nor the Noon of the Day

# nor a Corn of the Meal at the Feet of the Poor 
# well I never found a Way for a Nerd to reFer to a Day       :-(
# as a Bird in the Hay can reMain never Heard
# well I never saw a Door of a Car left aJar on the Floor    :-(
# to be Harmed by the Paw of a Whore in a Barn 

I never knew a Way to reNew
               Say      Through

  Say rePay   reTake reLay  reMake reMain
  reDo reNew reView reMove
  rePose supPose
  reFerred deMur

it's surprisingly hard to find the long vowels that I want
  to go:   ee oo ee oo,    oo ah oo ah,    or similar...

Could morse-thue the long vowels... :-)
