#4   can Only just brEAk up a bAr of milk chOcolate.

4   The wOrld is a wAr zone the lAst fifty yEArs,
4   from bUbble and crAsh, on to bUbble and crAsh;
4   so mUch of our wEAlth has been spEnt upon wEApons
    ( that wE are now bAnkrupt )
4   A whOle generAtion rose Up in revOlt
    explAIn it to chEney and J edgar hOover all Over agAIn
4   whOlly sepUlchral, we drIft to antIquity;
4   The hAt changes cOlour, the brAIn it does nOt

4   for ever     vendetta   to cleanse it   of all that

3   our bOdies belOng to us bOth
3   (like) a mAmmal allErgic to mIlk

    unUsually wIErd
    well bUgger a thUg
    and a gAUntlet of dOgs
    We knOw of no Other
4   CondEmned by our knOwledge, our prOUdest achIEvement,


5   Endless rejEction, a stAte of an Abject defEAt
5   The dOOrs which once slAmmed shut behInd me now shUt in my fAce
    I am dYing of lOneliness
5   and plAy out some tEdious Endgame with bArely a bAht

    Trial by Tea
    and it Has to be Brown
    and the Browner the Better
