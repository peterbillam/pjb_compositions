	To Do:
	one with cyclic backing, and solo (or too close to sometimes ?)
	one with 2-voices against 2-voices, as in late beethoven
	one very calm in sonorous counterpoint, with very few words
	songs in german, in french, in spanish, perhaps in esperanto
	rhythmic-unison and smooth, as in chorales, or Brahms Op.63 WoO.34
	rhythmic-unison (or duet?) and rhythmically vigorous, with a pulse and rests
