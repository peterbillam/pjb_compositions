4   A whOle generAtion rose Up in revOlt
    explAIn it to chEney and J edgar hOover all Over agAIn

5   Endless rejEction, a stAte of an Abject defEAt
5   The dOOrs which once slAmmed shut behInd me now shUt in my fAce
    I am dYing of lOneliness

    befOre me    behInd me  we knOw no   no Other
    I wAIt here  the Only   we were here
    mur igni     remember

    it sOUnds like a crY for my hElp and
    of whAt he he sIngs, is is lOst; yet his sOng is is nOt.

    for ever     vendetta   to cleanse it   of all that  
    Two hundred and seven cantankerous autists

    I hAve this recUrring bad drEAm where it's hIgh time
    a rEnegade hIppie just hAppy in rAgs
    tUrn up the vOlume to drOwn the distOrtion
    He stInks of stale wEEd,
    can Only just brEAk up a bAr of milk chOcolate.
    the hEIght of the hIgh there is clArity, Insight;  # see 20110630
    bearing Insights in Ev'ry domAIn
    a common deep pattern in many domains
    and remembered and recognised,
    and contemplate life
    and marvel at life

    young, green and sweet, or old known and wise,
    with you I converse unafraid -
    my lotus and sacrament my breath this night
    I do give to the life of the mind,
    and its deeds and its works everlasting,
    my inspiration, my muse

    from bubble and crash, on to bubble and crash
    the world is a war zone
    For the last fifty years,
    so much of our wealth has been spent upon weapons
    that we are now bankrupt
    A whole generation rose up in revolt
    Explain it to Cheney and J Edgar Hoover all over again
    The hat changes colour, the brain it does not

    Stagger or Strut or the One or the Other

    our Bodies beLong to us Both

    fluttering bunting
    unusually wierd
    well bugger a thug
    and a gauntlet of dogs
    drift to antiquity
    dangle and clang
    a life of the mind
    with manners more paleovisceral
    for gesture is born of repose, as is music of silence
    We know of no other
    Condemned by our knowledge, our proudest achievement,

    virtuosic opacity
    wholly sepulchral
    an utter delight of simplicity

    I am dying of lonliness
    endless rejection
    and play out some tedious endgame
    in state of abject defeat
    with barely a baht
    The doors which once slammed shut behind me now shut in my face
