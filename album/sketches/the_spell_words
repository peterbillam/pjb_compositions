THE SPELL

Peter Billam

The car is hot they're on the run
Their nostrils wide with wine and fun
The road sings underneath the sun
The beach will be their bed;
They're twenty-three and twenty-five
But no matter how fast they drive
The spell runs on ahead.

They're cuddled close, they're lying low,
The bed is warm with afterglow,
Their bodies touch from head to toe,
A tear forms in her eye.
The fields run in waves, the blackbirds call,
The log fire burns, the snowflakes fall,
As the spell flashes by.

When all she has for all her pains
Are lonely rides on crowded planes
And suitcases with tear-stains;
Hard to know what's going on.
We wander through our lonely maze
Of crazy nights and lazy days
And the spell will soon be gone.

#  A choir might be the Wrong Idiom :-(
#  The differences in mood would seem to demand a more neutral backing,
#   as in Desolation Row.  There's a danger this turns into ham acting...

He cannot sleep, he's near to tears,
Throws on his clothes and runs downstairs,
Catches the first cab that appears,
He cannot stand the doubt;
He knows the car outside her door
He goes back home and walks the floor
As the spell works itself out.

When all she has for all her pains
Are lonely rides on crowded planes
And suitcases with tear-stains,
It's time to wonder how;
She drinks no wine and eats no meat
While rival gangsters prowl the street(s?)
(And) the spell is running down.

Fate moves in mysterious ways;
(While ?) We wander through our lonely maze
Of crazy nights and lazy days
(I't hard to know, it's hard (extra line))
(It's hard)? to know what's going on.
But sometimes it seems (gets?) very clear,
While (though?) some folks fight and some folks fear,
The (that?) spell may soon be gone.
