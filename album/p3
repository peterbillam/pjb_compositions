Remember around us a whole generation
rose up in revolt, inspiration and youth.
Remember all gesture is born of repose, as is music of silence.
My young green and sweet, my old known and wise,
my muse, with you I converse unafraid.
My breath of this night I give,
my inspiration I give, to the life of the mind
and its deeds and its works everlasting;
remember . . .

The car is hot they're on the run
Their nostrils wide with wine and fun
The road sings underneath the sun
The beach will be their bed;
They're twenty-three and twenty-five
But no matter how fast they drive
The spell runs on ahead.
They're cuddled close, they're lying low,
The bed is warm with afterglow,
Their bodies touch from head to toe,
A tear forms in her eye.
The fields run in waves, the blackbirds call,
The log fire burns, the snowflakes fall,
As the spell flashes by.

The following tempi suggestions are editorial only
and should be disregarded at will.
\f2Sometimes\fP could last about 150 sec. \ 
\f2Konkerado\fP could last anywhere between 60 sec and 150 sec,
depending on acoustic and breath;
in a reverberant acoustic and given enough voices
staggered breathing could be organised
(the esperanto \ \f3jx\fP \ is pronounced
like the french \ \f3j\fP \ in \ \f3je\fP).
\f2Web\fP could last perhaps 190 sec,
though it might be easier somewhat slower.
\f2Only the Glories of the Night\fP could also last around 190 sec,
\f2Remember\fP could also last around 140 sec,
and \f2The Spell\fP perhaps around 180 sec.
