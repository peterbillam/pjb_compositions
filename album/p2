Sometimes I think I do \   sometimes I think I don't
Sometimes I think I will \   sometimes I think I won't
Sometimes I think I didn't \  sometimes I think I did,
Sometimes it's all on show \  sometimes I keep it hid
It's mine, it's mine, \  it's my tin of candy, my bottle of wine.
This stuff could kill me; \  shouldn't have it to hand.
So better use it up \  as fast as I can . . .
Sometimes I think I shouldn't \   but then I think I should
Sometimes I think I couldn't \   sometimes I think I could
I think maybe I hadn't \  but then I know I had
At first it seems O.K. \  but then I know it's bad
It's mine, it's mine, \  it's my tin of candy, my bottle of wine.

Only the glories of the night will be immortal;
the soil will turn to stone, the rain to flood,
the wind to war and the sun to evil rampant.
We will long for the night to uncover our eyes
as the stars in their thousands bejwell the deep far cold beyond
and more by the thousand of million will fling round the sky
a flowing milky light as vast as all our folly,
and the galaxy will turn majestic, slowly inward to be torn apart . . .
We will see far in those years, and lament much,
and fear for shame to meet a living eye.

\f3\s+2Well I Never\s-2\fP

Well I never knew a tedious June or a room with a tree
nor a tomb with a key or a seed on the moon
Well I never saw the car of a whore with the door left ajar
nor a farm with a brawl on the floor of the barn
Well I never found a way for a purr to be heard in the bay
but the bird to remain there to play in the fur
Well I never did believe there's a flaw in the law of the sea
nor a thorn in the weeds at the feet of the poor
Well I never knew the rune of a lay or the pay of a fool
nor of May coming soon  nor the noon of the day
