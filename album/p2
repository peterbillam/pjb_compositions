Sometimes I think I do \   sometimes I think I don't
Sometimes I think I will \   sometimes I think I won't
Sometimes I think I didn't \  sometimes I think I did,
Sometimes it's all on show \  sometimes I keep it hid
It's mine, it's mine, \  it's my tin of candy, my bottle of wine.
This stuff could kill me; \  shouldn't have it to hand.
So better use it up \  as fast as I can . . .
Sometimes I think I shouldn't \   but then I think I should
Sometimes I think I couldn't \   sometimes I think I could
I think maybe I hadn't \  but then I know I had
At first it seems O.K. \  but then I know it's bad
It's mine, it's mine, \  it's my tin of candy, my bottle of wine.

The car is hot they're on the run
Their nostrils wide with wine and fun
The road sings underneath the sun
The beach will be their bed;
They're twenty-three and twenty-five
But no matter how fast they drive
The spell runs on ahead.

They're cuddled close, they're lying low,
The bed is warm with afterglow,
Their bodies touch from head to toe,
A tear forms in her eye.
The fields run in waves, the blackbirds call,
The log fire burns, the snowflakes fall,
As the spell flashes by.
