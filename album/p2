Sometimes I think I do \   sometimes I think I don't
Sometimes I think I will \   sometimes I think I won't
Sometimes I think I didn't \  sometimes I think I did,
Sometimes it's all on show \  sometimes I keep it hid
It's mine, it's mine, \  it's my tin of candy, my bottle of wine.
This stuff could kill me; \  shouldn't have it to hand.
So better use it up \  as fast as I can . . .
Sometimes I think I shouldn't \   but then I think I should
Sometimes I think I couldn't \   sometimes I think I could
I think maybe I hadn't \  but then I know I had
At first it seems O.K. \  but then I know it's bad
It's mine, it's mine, \  it's my tin of candy, my bottle of wine.

Only the glories of the night will be immortal;
the soil will turn to stone, the rain to flood,
the wind to war and the sun to evil rampant.
We will long for the night to uncover our eyes
as the stars in their thousands bejwell the deep far cold beyond
and more by the thousand of million will fling round the sky
a flowing milky light as vast as all our folly,
and the galaxy will turn majestic, slowly inward to be torn apart . . .
We will see far in those years, and lament much,
and fear for shame to meet a living eye.

The car is hot they're on the run
Their nostrils wide with wine and fun
The road sings underneath the sun
The beach will be their bed;
They're twenty-three and twenty-five
But no matter how fast they drive
The spell runs on ahead.
They're cuddled close, they're lying low,
The bed is warm with afterglow,
Their bodies touch from head to toe,
A tear forms in her eye.
The fields run in waves, the blackbirds call,
The log fire burns, the snowflakes fall,
As the spell flashes by.
