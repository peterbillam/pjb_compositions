	crossrhythms: amazing how satisfying it sounds even all on one chord
	(by far the longest unchanging-harmony I've ever written)
	could publish mp3 of a bank 5 patch 1 performance,
	  plus a solo for piano right hand where one note can vary
	  (then perhaps later two) e.g.
	  pattern ? c A G : c# A G : c A G : B A G ?

	  or  4 c 8 A 4 G 8 c 4 A 8 G   which is a unit of nine eight-notes

	After a bar of three-note chord,
	  I could change the 4th note when it re-enters

you get with three-voice-voiceleading :-(
