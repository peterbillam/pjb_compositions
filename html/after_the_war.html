I was born in 1948, just after the war, so the musical culture I inherited
was from the generation before the war.
</P><P>
That had been an extraordinarily brilliant time. For example, just the
couple of years around 1910 gave us Stravinsky's <i>Petrushka</i>,
and the <i>Rite of Spring</i>, Bart&oacute;k's <i>Bluebeard's Castle</i>,
Debussy's <i>La Mer</i> and <I>Jeux</I>, Ravel's <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>,
Schoenberg's <i>Five Orchestral Pieces</i>, Busoni's <i>Doktor Faust</i>,
Delius' <i>A Mass of Life</i>, Scriabin's <i>Prometheus</i>,
<!-- Berg's <i>Wozzeck</i>, finished in 1922! -->
all the late Mahler symphonies including <i>The Song Of The Earth</i>,
and <i>Elektra</i> and <i>Salome</i> from Richard Strauss.
And those are just the big pieces. All that in just a couple of years!
It's a phenomenal outpouring.
</P><P>
I grew up listening to that, and sort of expecting to live in a world
in which that kind of cultural flowering would be the norm.
</P><P>
I remember, when I would have been about nine, having just learned
that the population of the world was about ten times greater than in
Beethoven's day, I asked my mother, "Where are the ten Beethovens then?"
</P><P>
Of course, she didn't know the answer.
</P><P>
Then, when I grew up in the late sixties and got to know the
composing scene in London, all was post-Webern serialism, Darmstadt,
Tanglewood, Universal Edition and associated competitions, festivals
and journals. Schoenberg, Berg and especially Webern were idols,
and Metre, Harmony, Melody and Theme were deprecated. The old German
music publishers, like Schott and Peters and Bote und Bock, continued
selling their Schubert and Brahms and so on, but did not add to their
catalogues. Universal Edition published works by hundreds of young
composers, who, producing either post-Webern serialist, or aleatoric,
or graphically notated, or conceptual works, tried as hard as they could
to produce important music; but because of the genre it was being written
in the public didn't take to it, and neither did most performers.
</P><P>
It was clear to me that a cultural tradition that had been alive before
the war was there no longer. What had happened ? 
</P><P>
Before 1944, there was the <I>OWI</I> (Office of War Information) which, in
spite of its name, was a civilian organisation reporting to the State
Department. The <I>OWI</I>'s job was to run cultural affairs in Allied-occupied
countries: theatre, literature, concerts, magazines, radio, newspapers
and so on. Most of their staff were idealistic, cultured young east-coast
graduates; composers Roy Harris and Marc Blitzstein headed their Music
Division and the <I>ABSIE</I> (American Broadcasting Station in Europe).
</P><P>
In 1944, with the invasion of France looming, Eisenhower changed the <I>OWI</I>
into the <I>PWD</I> (Psychological Warfare Division), giving it greater
autonomy from the civilian agencies, and more military associations.
</P><P>
Then, within occupied Germany, a military government was formed, and in
August 1945 the <I>PWD</I>, and most of its staff, were taken over by the
<I>ICD</I> (Information Control Division), reporting to <I>OMGUS</I> (Office
of Military Government United States), under the command of General Robert
McClure. He had authority over 37 newspapers, 6 radio stations, 314 theatres,
642 cinemas and 237 book-publishers.
</P><P>
McClure argued that <I>ICD</I>'s mission was to make the individual German
aware
that "we have waged war against
Germany, and not only against the Nazis"
and
"of his personal share in the collective German responsibility for the
acts of the Nazis and militarists", and to "accept Germany's guilt as
a nation as his personal guilt".
</P><P>
So he set about stripping away "German misconceptions about Germany and
its relationship with the world", of which one of the most important
was the Germans' pride in their musical tradition. Nazi propaganda had
promoted German Music proudly: the prominence of German composers had
been promoted as evidence of Aryan superiority, and the Nuremburg rallies
were choreographed to the music of Beethoven, Bruckner and Wagner. The
Nazis ran a big advertising campaign "Pflegt Deutsche Hausmusik!",
("Play German Chamber Music in Your Home!"), so obviously General
McClure wasn't keen to encourage the playing of German Chamber Music.
</P><P>
Furtw&auml;ngler was blacklisted for two years, not because the Americans
were blunderers or cultural illiterates, but because <I>ICD</I> saw the
conductor as he saw himself: as a preeminent symbol of German musical
culture. But whereas Furtw&auml;ngler cherished that culture as the wellspring
of civilisation, the <I>ICD</I> considered it the birthplace of Nazism.
</P><P>
However, while Robert McClure and the upper levels of the hierarchy
wanted an ongoing mopping-up operation against German culture, he was
undermined by his own staff in the <I>ICD</I> Music Branch, who felt their
job was to restart German culture, so as not to allow the Nazis and Soviets
to look like goodies and the Americans like baddies.
</P><P>
The fates of German musicians were determined, largely at random, by this
bureaucratic civil war, whose outcomes were made even more random by
regional committees controling arts in the Laender, and by interaction with
decisions made in the British, French and Russian zones. This process decided
the concert performances of composers like Egk, Hindemith, Orff, Pfitzner,
and Strauss, and the careers of Patzak, Schwarzkopf, Rosbaud, Munch,
Leitner, Krauss, Knappertsbusch, Griendl, Gieseking, Tietjen, Jochum, Solti,
B&ouml;hm, Leinsdorf, Karajan, Furtw&auml;ngler and their whole generation.
</P><P>
Meanwhile, the broader Denazification of german society was under way; all
germans were required to fill in a form, a <i>Fragebogen</i>, detailing
how close they were to the Nazi party. These forms were compared with each
other, and with Nazi-party records, and anyone who was a party-member
or a close associate, found themselves permanently unemployed in the
post-war era. The <I>ICD</I> was soon overwhelmed by the scale of that task,
but Michael Josselson and Nicholas Nabokov (the cousin of Vladimir the
famous novelist), who ended up running the Congress for Cultural Freedom,
cut their teeth working in the <I>OMGUS</I> offices comparing those forms,
and making denazification recommendations accordingly.
</P><P>
American music, in the eyes of senior planning officials, was always
thought to have a special role to play in Germany. Especially, the
State Department authorities saw American culture as the vanguard of
democratisation, and refused to authorise music by non-Americans, or even
of &eacute;migr&eacute;s such as Hindemith, Martinu or Krenek; these composers
were not deemed sufficiently representative of America to have reeducational
value. So the Music Branch promoted works by Piston, Harris, Schuman,
Thompson, Copland, Barber, and Gershwin. Robert McBride's <i>Strawberry
Jam Overture</i> went down very badly, Piston's <i>Incredible Flutist</i>
and <i>Concertino for Piano and Orchestra</i> also went badly. Several
composers working for the Music Branch took the opportunity to get their
own works performed, like John Bitter, John Evarts, Harrison Kerr,
Everett Helm, and also those works did not convince German audiences
that American music had any value. But Menotti's <i>The Old Maid and the
Thief</i> went OK, and Barber's <i>Adagio</i> was well received. The real
hit was Gershwin's <i>Porgy and Bess</i>, which however was double-edged,
because it does portray life in America as harsh and uncivilised, and
unforgiving especially for blacks.
</P><P>
Although <I>ICD</I>'s Music Branch tried to get musical culture restarted,
they only really had influence over performance. They had little say in
the future of the composing tradition itself. And what happened to the
composing tradition? By 1946 already, while germans were still starving,
and freezing in winter, <I>OMGUS</I> had already set up the Darmstadt Music
School.
</P><P>
<I>OMGUS</I> knew right from the beginning that Darmstadt music was unloved.
I quote an official <I>OMGUS</I> report from 1947: "It was generally conceded
that much of this music was worthless and had better been left unplayed.
The over-emphasis on twelve-tone music was regretted. One critic described
the concerts as 'The Triumph of Dillettantism' . . . The French students
remained aloof from the others and acted in a snobbish way, and their
teacher, Leibowitz, represents and admits as valid only the most radical
kind of music and is openly disdainful of any other. His attitude is aped
by his students. It was generally felt that next year's course must follow
a different, more catholic, pattern." But that change did not occur.
</P><P>
In August 1947, the Music Branch had managed to get Furtw&auml;ngler cleared,
and permitted to conduct a benefit concert for jewish refugees, with the
American violinist Yehudi Menuhin as soloist. But others in the hierarchy
were not in favour. The Military Police checked the papers of everyone
coming in to the hall; they relented when the concert was already an
hour late in starting, but throughout the performance they moved up and
down the aisles, checking all passes and evicting anyone whose papers
were not in order. They also cleared the hall at the end of the music,
before anyone could applaud.
</P><P>
But meanwhile, the American enemy was changing from Germany to Russia.
</P><P>
Addressing Congress in March 1947 on the situation in Greece, where a
Communist takeover threatened, President Truman appealed in apocalyptic
language for a new age of American intervention: "at the present moment in
world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways
of life!" he declared. This ideological call-to-arms was immediately
enshrined as the <i>Truman Doctrine</i>.
</P><P>
On 5 June 1947, General George Marshall, the US Army's wartime Chief
of Staff and now Truman's Secretary of State, announced the <i>Marshall
Plan</i> to deal with the 'great crisis'. Warning that "the whole world
[and] . . . the way of life we have known is literally in the balance",
he called upon the New World to step into the breach with a crash
programme of financial credits and large-scale material assistance,
and thus prevent the collapse of the Old World.
</P><P>
On 26 July, the National Security Act created the <I>CIA</I> (Central
Intelligence Agency), to coordinate military and diplomatic intelligence,
and to carry out unspecified "services of common concern" and "such
other functions and duties" as the National Security Council might
direct. Its covert operations wing was called the <I>OPC</I> (Office of Policy
Coordination) and was made part of the Policy Planning Staff in the
State Department.
</P><P>
Meanwhile on the other side, in October 1947, ComInform (the Communist
Information Bureau) held its first meeting in Belgrade. Formed in Moscow
the previous September, ComInform replaced the defunct ComIntern. Andrei
Zhadanov, architect of Stalin's ruthless cultural policy, told the
Communists of western Europe that they had: "achieved considerable
success in conduction work among the Intelligentsia. Proof of this is
the fact that in these countries the best people of science, art and
literature belong to the Communist Party, are heading the movement of
the progressive struggle, are winning more and more intellectuals to
the cause of Communism."
</P><P>
In March 1949 ComInform boldly staged a "Cultural and Scientific
Conference for World Peace" in the New York Waldorf Astoria, where
it was besieged by right-wing protesters. Nicolas Nabokov attended a
panel where Shostakovich was one of the speakers. After a dull session,
Nabokov was finally given the floor. "On such-and-such a date in Pravda
appeared an unsigned article that had all the looks of an editorial. It
concerned three western composers: Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg,
and Igor Stravinsky. In this article, they were branded, all three of
them, as 'obscurantists', 'decadent bourgeois formalists' and 'lackeys of
imperialist capitalism'. The performance of their music should 'therefore
be prohibited in the U.S.S.R.' Does Mr Shostakovich personally agree with
this official view as printed in Pravda?". "Provokatsya! (Provocation!)"
cried the Russians, as Shostakovich received whispered instructions from
his KGB 'nurse'. The composer then stood up, was handed a microphone
and, ashen face turned down to the floorboards, murmured in Russian, "I
fully agree with this official view as printed in Pravda." Rumours that
Shostakovich had been ordered to attend the conference by Stalin himself
had reached this New York gathering; any display of independent spirit
on his part was a life or death matter. Nabokov was throwing punches at
a man whose arms were tied behind his back.
</P><P>
The Waldorf Astoria conference was a humiliation for its Communist
backers. "It was," said one observer, "a propagandist's nightmare, a
fiasco that proved the last hurrah for the idea that the ideological
interests of Stalinist Russia could be grafted onto progressive
traditions in America." The American Communist Party was now in
retreat, its membership at an all-time low, its prestige irrevocably
tarnished. Just when claims of a Communist conspiracy began to take a
feverish grip, Stalin's strategists all but turned their back on America,
and concentrated instead on extending influence in Europe.
</P><P>
The American reply was a large congess in Berlin in April 1950, called
the <i>Congress for Cultural Freedom</i>, which is a story in itself,
but it went a lot better than the Waldorf Astoria. The <I>OPC</I> then made
the <i>Congress for Cultural Freedom</i> a permanent institution, gave
it the codename QKOPERA, appointed Nabokov and Josselson to run it,
and moved its headquarters to the relative security of Paris.
</P><P>
<I>OMGUS</I> was rapidly down-sized and starved of funds, and by 1950 it had been
dissolved. But Darmstadt remained. The idol of Darmstadt was Webern, who
certainly wasn't chosen for being anti-Nazi; he had written an extatic,
almost orgasmic, letter rejoicing in Hitler's rise to power. That letter
is quoted in Alex Ross' book: <I>The Rest Is Noise</I>.
</P><P>
Both the Nazis and the Russians had run fierce propaganda campaigns -
posters, newspaper cartoons and so on - attacking Americans as people
with no culture, only interested in money and weapons. So the Congress
started a huge campaign to show that Americans could do culture just as
well as Europeans, and that Art under Capitalism has a creative fervour
that is suppressed under Nazism or Communism.
</P><P>
In cinema, Hollywood produced films like <i>An American in Paris</i>
(1951), featuring Gershwin's music, and portraying Americans as young,
vigorous and scrupulously honourable people, who loved Europe, and
who loved culture and did it superbly: just as well as Europeans,
but newer.
</P><P>
On 1 April 1952, the <i>Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century</i>
festival opened in Paris with <i>The Rite of Spring</i> performed by the
Boston Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Monteux, who had premiered it
thirty-nine years earlier. It was a glittering event, with Stravinsky
in attendance, flanked by the French President and his wife. For
thirty days, the Congress for Cultural Freedom showered Paris with
a hundred symphonies, concertos, operas and ballets by over seventy
twentieth-century composers. There were nine orchestras, including the
Vienna Philharmonic, the RIAS, the Suisse Romande, the Santa Cecilia, the
National Radiodiffusion Fran&ccedil;aise. Topping the bill were those composers
who had been banned by Hitler or Stalin or, preferably, by both. There
were works by Arnold Schoenberg, driven out of Germany as a Jew and a
composer of 'decadent music' in 1933, and denounced as "anti-aesthetic,
anti-harmonic, chaotic and inane" by Russian music 'critics'; by Paul
Hindemith, another refugee from Nazi Germany, derided by Stalinists
for initiating a whole school of "graphic linear pseudo-counterpoint
which is slavishly followed by so many pseudo-modernists in Europe and
America"; and Claude Debussy, under whose 'Impressionist tree' the
'fleurs du mal of modernism' had been allowed to grow, according to
<i>Sovietskaya Muzyka</i>.
</P><P>
Also representing the "validity of the creative effort of our century"
were works by Barber, Walton, Mahler, Satie, Bart&oacute;k, Villa-Lobos,
Pizzetti, Rieti, Malipiero, Georges Auric (listed with Darius Milhaud in
<i>Sovietskaya Muzyka</i> as "servile teasers of the snobbish bourgeois
tastes of a capitalist city"), Honneger, Jean Fran&ccedil;aix, Sauget, Poulenc
and Aaron Copland (who was grouped with psychiatrists Freud and Borneigg,
philosopher Bergson, and 'gangsters' Raymond Mortimer and Bertrand
Russell, as false authorities to whom Soviet musicologists and critics
should never refer). Stravinsky conducted his own <i>Oedipus Rex</i>,
for which Jean Cocteau designed the set and the choreography.
</P><P>
Even British intelligence was aghast at the scale on which its American
counterpart was endowing the cultural Cold War; Malcolm Muggeridge later
wrote: "How soon our British setup was overtaken in personnel, zest and
scale of operation, above all, in expendable cash! The OSS-CIA network,
with ramifications all over the world, came to outclass our once legendary
Secret Service as a sleek Cadillac does an ancient hansom cab."
</P><P>
In cinema, Hollywood produced <i>Roman Holiday</i> (1953).
</P><P>
The next festival Nabokov arranged was his answer to Herbert Read's
criticism of the retrospective nature of the Paris venture: "Let our
next exhibition be, then, not a complacent look at the past, but a
confident look into the future !" At a press conference in New York
in February 1953, Nabokov announced: "With that festival we shut the
door of the past," he said. "We said, in effect, here are the great
works. They are no longer 'modern' even though they originated in the
twentieth century. They are now a part of history. Now, I have a new
plan . . . we are going to have a composer's contest that is unlike any
other competition ever held."
</P><P>
The <i>International Conference of Twentieth Century Music</i>, to be held
in Rome in April 1954, announced the Congress' commitment to the promotion
of avant-garde composition. It was to place the Congress firmly on the
map as part of the vanguard in musical experiment, and offered the world
a rich example of the kind of music expressly forbidden by Stalin.
</P><P>
Money poured in from the Farfield Foundation, to endow the competition
with prizes totalling 25,000 Swiss francs for the best violin concerto,
short symphony, and chamber music for voice and instruments. The press
release announced that the festival, "designed to prove that art thrives
on freedom", was the beneficiary of a generous donation from "U.S. gin
and yeast heir Julius Fleischmann", who was also brought in to negotiate
with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which agreed to perform the winning
composition at its subsiduary, Tanglewood (by 1953, eight of the eleven
members of the music advisory board of the Congress were associated with
the Tanglewood music school). Nabokov sent the first invitation to his
old friend, Igor Stravinsky, paying expenses of $5,000 for the maestro,
wife and secretary to attend. Stravinsky also chaired the music advisory
board for the festival, alongside Samuel Barber, Boris Blacher, Benjamin
Britten, Carlos Chavez, Luigi Dallapiccola, Arthur Honegger, Francesco
Malipiero, Frank Martin, Darius Milhaud and Virgil Thompson. Charles Munch
had proposed that Toscanini be invited to join the board, but Nabokov
refused: "the name of Toscanini connected with a project concerning
contemporary music sounds, to say the least, anachronistic. The good
Maestro . . . has been a consistent and determined enemy of contemporary
music, and has at many occasions attacked its main protagonists."
</P><P>
In early 1954, the Congress set up a festival office in the noble
surroundings of the Palazzo Pecci, courtesy of Count Pecci-Blunt,
a close friend of Nabokov's, and, despite his title, an American
citizen. Treasurer Pierre Bolomey organised a credit line with the
Congress's Chase National Bank account in Basle, through which <I>CIA</I>
money was funnelled. Pecci-Blunt made a personal contribution of $1300,
and a further $10,000 was channelled through Denis de Rougemont's
<i>Centre Europ&eacute;en de la Culture</i>, which was also receiving
money from the Farfield Foundation, and was given top billing on the
programme. Arrangements were secured for the travel of Leontyne Price,
and round trip tickets dispatched to Aaron Copland, Michael Tippett,
Joseph Fuchs and Ben Weber.
</P><P>
In March 1954, Nabokov announced the festival line-up. With a heavy
concentration on atonal, dodecaphonic composition, the aesthetic direction
of the event pointed very much to the progressive avant-garde of Alban
Berg, Elliot Carter, Luigi Dallapiccola and Luigi Nono. Amongst the 'new'
composers were Peter Racine Fricker, Lou Harrison and Mario Peragallo,
all of whose work was influenced in varying degrees by twelve-tone
composition. They were, on the whole, well received. <i>Musical
America</i> noted that "most of the composers and critics making up the
committees responsible for the concerts have not been known in the past
for their friendliness to dodecaphonic principles or proponents. For
this reason, the programs they offered were not only surprising,
but encouraging as well." A recent convert to twelve-tone music was
Stravinsky, whose presence in Rome signalled a major moment in the
convergence of modernist tributaries in the serialist 'orthodoxy'. For
Nabokov, there was a clear political message in promoting music which
did away with old hierarchies, as a liberation from outdated laws about
music's inner logic. Later, critics would wonder whether serialism had
broken its emancipatory promise, driving music into a modernist cul-de-sac
where it sat, restricted and difficult, tyrranised by despotic formulae,
and commanding an increasingly specialised audience. Susan Sontag wrote:
"Towards its squawks and thumps, we were deferential - we knew we were
supposed to appreciate ugly music; we listened devoutly to the Toch,
the Krenek, the Hindemith, the Webern, the Schoenberg, whatever (we had
enormous appetites and strong stomachs)." Even the most deferential
amongst those attending the Congress festival in Rome whistled and
shouted when one performance turned into a 'private soliloquy', and
when Hans Werner Henze's twelve-tone opera <i>Boulevard Solitude</i>
was premiered, the audience could be forgiven for feeling as if it was
travelling along a <I>via dolorosa</I>.
</P><P>
Perhaps sensing a challenge to his own brand of difficulty, Pierre
Boulez wrote Nabokov a furious letter larded with insults. Nabokov,
he said, was encouraging a "folklore of mediocrity", nurtured by petty
bureaucrats obsessed with the number twelve - "A Council of Twelve,
a Committee of Twelve, a Jury of Twelve" - but who understood nothing
of the creative process. Boulez went on to accuse the Congress of
manipulating young composers by offering them large prizes (the winners
were Lou Harrison, Giselher Klebe, Jean-Louis Martinet, Mario Peragallo,
and Vladimir Vogel).
</P><P>
In 1955 I was seven years old in London; LPs arrived and <i>Saga Records</i>
appeared, costing just ten shillings - about 70 cents - and featuring
only American or British artists. I grew up listening to those LPs,
to Maurice Cole playing the Well-Tempered Clavier, and the Fine Arts
Quartet playing Beethoven opus 131 and the six Bart&oacute;k quartets.
</P><P>
I didn't yet realise it, but by 1955, all the machinery was in place
that I would get to know when making music in London in the late sixties:
Darmstadt, Tanglewood, Universal Edition, the competitions and festivals
and journals, and underlying all, post-Webern serialism.
</P><P>
The <i>Congress for Cultural Freedom</i> was dissolved in 1967, after
years of leaks about its funding; by then, the <I>CIA</I> funding had become
such public knowledge that most of the governing committee resigned
in a rush pretending they hadn't been told, and the <i>Congress</i>
was dissolved. But Universal Edition and post-Webern serialism were
already in place, and they lived on.
</P><P>
Composing is half the division-of-labour which
defines the western art-music culture,
and no body can survive for long with its head severed.
Between them, <I>OMGUS</I> and the <I>Congress for Cultural Freedom</I>
severed the composing tradition of classical music,
<!-- because it was a Nazi icon and also unprofitable for Show-Biz, -->
and preserved classical music
as a teaching and performing tradition with a static repertoire,
knowing that, in the recording era, a static repertoire can not survive.
