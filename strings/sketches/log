    20140912          at 10 smq/sec         jig
      BUT there is a qua voice, which is 5 qua/sec ... :-)
      OR  equivalently, at half speed for a while ...

    20141004 20141002 at 8 smq/sec          murmer, seethe
      11/16, also not coprime with 8;  but just feasible at 10smq/sec ...
	  although so different in texture that a tempo-change is no problem

    20141001          at 4.44 smq/sec       rhythmic texture
      could be 4 or 5; both are fine :-)    could work as glue, to and fro

20141019
	Just as the jig 20140912 could follow on from 20141015
	so the 'cro. qua' rhythm of 20140914 could follow on from 20141013
	So 20141019 could return shortened so as to spawn different offspring

20141020
	and indeed 20140914 can end in cycle?cro:qua? and thus precede 20141015

	Now to rethink the dancy 20140912 and join up

20141021
	perhaps :  1) 6v counterpoint  2) rhythm  3) sad but dignified

20141120
	mvt2 bits in 20141118:
	  Rhythm at cluster=7 uses up 5 instruments; will need to economise

20141121
	overall: too continuous ; not enough rests, not enough pizz
	We have Seethe, Jiggy, Rhythm and Slide;
	  the Jiggy is the bit that should change.

	The things I was going to have that I haven't got yet:
	  cresc-from-nothing ... loud ... dim-to-nothing (messa-di-voce)
	  pizz-and-gliss-upwards
	  anything else ?

20141122
	the messa-di-voce can work on the Seethe or on the Slide

20141123
	From the Diary:
	GlissPizz fits with Slide, Rhythm and Seethe
	Apart from Seethe->Rhythm, so I have other good discontinuities ?
	Beggining : GlissPizz into Seethe , then upwards
	then cut to Rhythm
	then cross-fade to Slide
	then mix in GlissPizz
	then cross-fade to Seethe
	then cross-fade to Rhythm
	  (could fill in here ?)
	then Rhythm mixed with GlissPizz
	one last GlissPizz into final Seethe, then downwards mixed with Slide
	ending in a fade-out, or some final cheap trick ?

	So far that makes 2 Slides, 3 Seethes, 2 Rhythms
	GlissPizz is not really viable on its own for longer than a second or so

20150111
	will combine a perhaps one-voice Seethe
	Don't forget the Jiggy from 20141118 !

20150112
	Rhythm divides the octave into ranges;
	Seethe also has multiple voices,
	  but they co-ordinate, covering a cluster which can wander up and down
	A single-voice Seethe is within morphing-distance to one voice in a Rhythm
	Rhythm and Seethe can be _combined_ with each other,
	  or they can evolve from one to the other.
	So, how to weave a story involving Rhythm and Seethe ?
	Other tricks:
	  slow down-gliss of a (eg) 3-voice chord
	  a few more GlissPizzes (but don't over-use)
	  Pizz-halt (at the _end_ of the bar) introducing a GP
	Unused:
	  tremolo //,
	  trill,
	  wagnerian-arpeggi-scales,
	  repeated notes! or octavise..

	Not dreamed of so far:
	  a soaring melody, eg over a Rhythm - but too inappropriate ?

	Could also octavise Seethe-voices and give them big. melodic ranges
	  using, basically, alternating even/odd WT-chords at semiquaver pulse...
	And could combine that with typical Seethe-voices,
	  which are already even/odd

20150118
	Could: Rhythm just the rhythm ! and melodise freely, eg: even/odd
	  This would make a logical continuation of Rhythm1 through Rhythm2 to ...

	Could: GlissPizz into something contrased against a Seethe,
	  but starting deceptively the same
	
20150128
	three minutes of not-yet-joined-up mvt2 already; within sight...
	  recap the first Rhythm  ?
	  slithering trill-masses
	  gliss 042-chord
	  another pizz-halt
