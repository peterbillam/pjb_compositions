Six players, but performances with twelve or more players
are also intended.

It shares the 2+2+2 sextet instrumentation of
my transcription of Bach's \f2Ricercare a 6\fP,
and of Schoenberg's chamber version of \f2Verklaerte Nacht\fP.
It's also not too far from the chamber-septet version of John Adams'
\f2Shaker Loops\fP, which adds a bass and uses three violins and
one viola rather than two and two.

 I  72 - 76 cro/min, \  4min 50sec

 II 125 - 135 cro/min, \  4min 25sec

The trills join up as smoothly as possible with the next trill,
and the glissandi at the end should join up
from instrument to instrument as smoothly as possible,
The glissandi should all move all move evenly from start-point to end-point,
so that glissando-chords (eg: bar 30...)
remain in-tune chords even as they slide,
The pizzicati in general should be played strongly.
In the seething passages in 16th-notes, the bowing is at your discretion;
I thought perhaps the violins could bow every note up-down-up-down,
while the violas could slur them in pairs
and the cellos slur them in fours;
but when it's just the two violas (eg: bars 1... or 119...)
then preferably they should bow every note
(else they reveal the beat, which is not otherwise revealed).
The crescendo in the last two bars should go up to absolutely
as loud as possible, using as many bow-changes as necessary.

 III  60 cro/min, \  5min 15sec

Likewise, the crescendo in the bar 5 should go up to absolutely
as loud as possible, using as many bow-changes as necessary,
and the \f2pesante\fP should be sempre \f4fff\fP.
