 We who mourn
 We gather here in song
 We gather here to mourn
 All the life of the world, all the flesh and wood of earth
 A billion years of sun and breath,
 And love and food, and fear and death,
 All the life of the ages, every dawn and every birth
 We gather here to mourn

 II 112 cro/min
 We grieve to lose what we achieved.
 We grieve for love of word and number, pen and poem;
 We sing of bow and string, cloth and home,
 We sing for love of book and dance and poet,
 Of every rope, every tenon, every boat;
 For what we made and sang and thought and built and wrote.
 Before the rain and tide
 Wash these pages from our empty rooms and feed them to the ocean,
 We gather here to grieve.

 III  72 cro/min
 The long light years
 round our only world,
 cold and far,
 they bear no song.

 We mourn alone,
 mourn our lonely world,
 mourn deep,
 will soon be gone.

 We will not mourn long;
 the long light years
 will bear no song.
