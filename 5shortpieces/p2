These five short pieces for guitar are Peter Billam's
first recorded compositions, written when studying classical guitar
in Biel, Switzerland, in the late 1970s.

Reasonable tempi might be:
56-60 beats per minute for the Prelude,
72 beats per minute for the Serenade,
132 beats per minute for the Mazurka,
132-138 beats per minute for the Jig,
and back to 56-60 beats per minute for the Air.

.PP
.nh
The slurs in bar 2 of the Prelude,
bars 17 and 18 of the Serenade,
and in bars 1, 2, 8, 9, 16, 17, 23 and 24 of the Mazurka
are intended to imply a sort of fast glissando.

.PP
.nh
In the Jig, in the first few bars and in similar passages,
the grace notes on the 4th string should be simultaneous with
the open B on the 2nd string.
