      BUT there is a qua voice, which is 5 qua/sec ... :-)
      OR  equivalently, at half speed for a while ...

    20141004 20141002 at 8 smq/sec          murmer, seethe
      11/16, also not coprime with 8;  but just feasible at 10smq/sec ...
	  although so different in texture that a tempo-change is no problem

    20141001          at 4.44 smq/sec       rhythmic texture
      could be 4 or 5; both are fine :-)    could work as glue, to and fro

	Just as the jig 20140912 could follow on from 20141015
	so the 'cro. qua' rhythm of 20140914 could follow on from 20141013
	So 20141019 could return shortened so as to spawn different offspring

20141020
	and indeed 20140914 can end in cycle?cro:qua? and thus precede 20141015

	Now to rethink the dancy 20140912 and join up

	perhaps :  1) 6v counterpoint  2) rhythm  3) sad but dignified
