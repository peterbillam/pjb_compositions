\f3\s+2Casida of lamenting\s0\fP

.IP \  4.5c
I closed the balcony door
.br
because I don't want to hear the lamenting,
.br
but beyond the grey walls
.br
there is nothing to be heard but lamenting.
.IP \  4.5c
Very few angels are singing,
.br
very few dogs are barking,
.br
a thousand violins fit in the palm of my hand.
.IP \  4.5c
But lamenting is an enormous dog,
.br
lamenting is an enormous angel,
.br
lamenting is an enormous violin,
.br
tears choke the wind,
.br
and there is nothing to be heard but lamenting.

The rose
.br
was not seeking the dawn:
.br
almost eternal on its branch,
.br
it was seeking something else.
.IP \  4.5c
The rose
.br
was seeking neither science nor shadow:
.br
slave of flesh and dream,
.br
it was seeking something else.
.IP \  4.5c
The rose
.br
was not seeking the rose.
.br
Immobile in the sky,
.br
it was seeking something else.

In the branches of the laurel
.br
go two dark doves.
.br
One was the sun,
.br
the other the moon.
.br
`Neighbours' I said to them,
.br
`where is my tomb ?'
.br
`In my tail', said the sun.
.br
`In my throat', said the moon.
.br
And I who was walking
.br
with the earth around my waist
.br
saw two snow-white eagles
.br
and a naked young girl.
.br
One was the other
.br
and the girl was neither.
.br
`Eagles,' I said to them,
.br
`where is my tomb ?'
.br
`In my tail', said the sun.
.br
`In my throat', said the moon.
.br
In the branches of the laurel
.br
I saw two naked doves.
.br
One was the other
.br
And both were neither.
