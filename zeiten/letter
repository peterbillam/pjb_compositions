Dear Sirs,

.LP
I hope I may write to you in English;
I read German more fluently than I write it.
I write to you in the hope that you are the copyright holder of
Friedrich Georg Jünger's poem "Wechsel der Zeiten".
I was referred to you by the notes in the back of
"Deutsche Gedichte 1930\-1960", edited by Hans Bender, published by Reclam.

.LP
I am a composer, and I am setting to music, for choir, the three poems
"Große Zeiten" by Erich Kästner,
"Die Gestundete Zeit" by Ingeborg Bachmann, and
"Wechsel der Zeiten" by Friedrich Georg Jünger.

.LP
I enclose a copy of the work in progress
so that you can see "what kind of music" this is.
I should emphasise that this score is not the final version,
and many, mostly small, changes may occur in it.

.LP
I would like to publish these songs on my web site www.pjb.com.au.
I was the first, and as far as I know I am still the only,
composer to be selling his works in score form,
with on-line payment and on-line delivery.
The price is expected to be approximately 13 Australian Dollars
(1 Australian Dollar is currently about .55 US Dollars).
Sale volumes are expected to be very low, at least initially.

.LP
I write to ask you :
.IP \ \ \ \(bu
whether you are the copyright holder for
Friedrich Georg Jünger's poem "Wechsel der Zeiten",
.IP \ \ \ \(bu
what sort of copyright agreement you would consider appropriate, and
.IP \ \ \ \(bu
what level of royalties you would expect to receive.
.LP
If it is appropriate that you receive a significant royalty,
I hope you will also be able to help publicise the work.


.PP
I look forward to hearing from you,
