This chorus is the second in a series of three, called \f3Die Zeiten\fP.

on \f2Große Zeiten\fP by Erich Kästner, can not be published until 2045,
so the remaining two are being published as separate pieces.
The third in the series, on \f2Wechsel der Zeiten\fP by Friedrich Georg Jünger,
is already available.
