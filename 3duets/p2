\f3\s+9Three Duets\s-9\fP
.sp 3.0c

These three duets were written with two flutes particularly in mind,
but are also intended for any two treble-clef instruments;
violins would also be excellent,
and flute and violin perhaps best of all.

They are just playable on recorders.
When played on recorders,
the first and third should be played with two Alto recorders,
and the second with Alto and Tenor.

The following tempo suggestions are editorial only,
and should be disregarded with a clear conscience.
The first movement, \f2Flowing\fP,
might be best taken at between 112 and 120 crochets per minute,
the second movement, \f2Sustained\fP,
at between say 72 and 92 crochets per minute,
and the third movement, \f2Lively\fP,
between 100 and 126 crochets per minute.
The crochet in the third movement should be
faster than that in the second.
